2025-04-23 12:18:19,New SEC chair ‘will be good for Bitcoin’ — Michael Saylor,Cointelegraph,"Michael Saylor, the CEO of top corporate Bitcoin holder Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), expressed support for newly appointed US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins.In an April 23 X post, Saylor wrote that “SEC Chairman Paul Atkins will be good for Bitcoin.” The statement follows Atkins’ swearing-in as the 34th chairman of the SEC on April 21.Source: Michael SaylorBlue Macellari, the head of digital assets at investment firm T. Rowe Price, also commented positively on Atkins’ swearing in during a recent Bloomberg interview. She seemed hopeful and recognized a change in how the SEC has acted under the new administration, particularly with crypto-related information, including “close to six or seven roundtables” with industry professionals. She said:“I think that that’s gonna feed into the ability to make thoughtful and considerate policies.”Vincent Liu , chief investment officer at crypto investment firm Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that “under Chair Atkins, finalizing custody rules for digital assets is expected to provide the investor protections that institutions demand.” Other issues expected to be resolved are clarification on whether some digital assets are securities or commodities:“Together, these two moves will help establish clear custody standards and bring much-needed clarity paving the way for the next wave of crypto product innovation.”Related: SEC and feds charge man over $200M crypto trading schemeWho is Atkins, and what does he mean for crypto?Accolades from representatives of the crypto industry readily followed Atkins’ appointment by US President Trump in late 2024. Bitwise Asset Management general counsel Katherine Dowling said at the time that he is a “great choice,” and Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he “will bring common sense back to the agency.”Not everyone was happy with the choice. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said during Atkins’s nomination hearing that he had had “staggeringly bad judgment” in his role as a SEC commissioner leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Atkins served at the agency from 2002 to 2008.She also raised an issue with his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, which had advised the crypto exchange FTX before its 2022 collapse. Warren said:“Your clients pay you north of $1,200 an hour for advice on how to influence regulators like the SEC, and if you’re confirmed, you will be in a prime spot to deliver for all those clients who’ve been paying you millions of dollars for years.”Liu said that “to maintain public trust and avoid even the perception of regulatory conflict of interest, it’s essential to implement clear guardrails.” Such a guardrail would include mandatory disclosures of prior industry ties, ethics oversight, and transparent public comment periods for all crypto rules.Related: SEC says it won’t re-file fraud case against Hex’s Richard HeartAtkins accused of biasWarren also sent a letter to Atkins in late March, stating that he should expect questions about his potential role at the agency due to his ties to the crypto industry through Patomak. Before being appointed, Atkins revealed a personal and family financial portfolio worth more than $327 million, according to a public ethics filing released ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing. Similarly, Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, David Sacks, filed a notice in early March suggesting that his venture capital firm sold more than $200 million in crypto and related stocks ahead of assuming his role.Magazine: Your AI ‘digital twin’ can take meetings and comfort your loved ones",https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-sec-chairm-will-be-good-for-bitcoin-strategy-s-michael-saylor?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-04-23 09:45:14,Crypto drainers now sold as easy-to-use malware at IT industry fairs,Cointelegraph,"Crypto drainers, malware designed to steal cryptocurrency, have become easier to access as the ecosystem evolves into a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model.In an April 22 report, crypto forensics and compliance firm AMLBot revealed that many drainer operations have transitioned to a SaaS model known as drainer-as-a-service (DaaS). The report revealed that malware spreaders can rent a drainer for as little as 100 to 300 USDt (USDT).Crypto drainers report image. Source: AMLBotAMLBot CEO Slava Demchuk told Cointelegraph that “previously, entering the world of cryptocurrency scams required a fair amount of technical knowledge.” That is no longer the case. Under the DaaS model, “getting started isn’t significantly more difficult than with other types of cybercrime.”Demchuk explained that would-be drainer users join online communities to learn from experienced scammers who provide guides and tutorials. This is how many criminals involved with traditional phishing campaigns transition to the crypto drainer space.Related: North Korean hackers target crypto devs with fake recruitment testsCybercrime in Russia — almost legalGroups offering crypto drainers as a service are increasingly bold and some are evolving almost like traditional business models, Demchuk said, adding:“Interestingly, some drainer groups have become so bold and professionalized that they even set up booths at industry conferences — CryptoGrab being one such example.“When asked how a criminal operation can send representatives to information technology industry events without repercussions, such as arrests, he pointed to Russian cybercrime enforcement as the reason. “This can all be done in jurisdictions like Russia, where hacking is now essentially legalized if you're not operating across the post-Soviet space,” he said.The practice has been an open secret in the cybersecurity industry for many years. Cybersecurity news publication KrebsOnSecurity reported in 2021 that “virtually all ransomware strains” deactivate without causing harm if they detect Russian virtual keyboards installed.Similarly, the information stealer Typhon Reborn v2 checks the user’s IP geolocation against a list of post-Soviet countries. According to networking firm Cisco, if it determines that it is located in one of those countries, it deactivates. The reason is simple: Russian authorities have shown that they will act if local hackers hit citizens of the post-Soviet bloc.Related: What is Bitcoinlib, and how did hackers target it?Drainers keep growingDemchuk further explained that DaaS organizations usually find their clientele within existing phishing communities. This includes gray and black hat forums on both clearnet (regular internet) and darknet (deep web), as well as Telegram groups and channels and gray market platforms.In 2024, Scam Sniffer reported that drainers were responsible for about $494 million in losses, a 67% increase over the previous year, despite a 3.7% increase in the number of victims. Drainers are on the increase, with cybersecurity giant Kaspersky reporting that the number of online resources dedicated to them on darknet forums rose from 55 in 2022 to 129 in 2024.Developers are often recruited through normal job adverts. AMLBot’s open-source intelligence investigator, who prefers to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told Cointelegraph that while researching drainers, his team “did come across several job postings specifically targeting developers to build drainers for Web3 ecosystems.”He provided one job advert that described the required features of a script that would empty Hedera (HBAR) wallets. Once again, the offer was mainly targeted at Russian speakers:“This request was originally written in Russian and shared in a developer-focused Telegram chat. It’s a clear example of how technical talent is actively recruited in niche, often semi-open communities.“The investigator further added that ads like this appear in Telegram chats for smart-contract developers. Those chats are not private or restricted, but they are small, with usually 100 to 200 members.Administrators quickly deleted the announcement provided as an example. Still, “as is often the case, those who needed to see it had already taken note and responded.”Traditionally, this kind of business was conducted on specialized clearnet forums and deep web forums accessible through the Tor network. Still, the investigator said that much of the content moved to Telegram thanks to its policy against sharing data with authorities. This changed following the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov:“As soon as Telegram announced that it was giving out data, then the outflow to Tor started again, because it is easier to protect oneself there.”Still, this is a concern to cybercriminals that may no longer be relevant. Earlier this week, Durov expressed misgivings over a growing threat to private messaging in France and other European Union countries, warning that Telegram would rather exit certain markets than implement encryption backdoors that undermine user privacy.Magazine: As Ethereum phishing gets harder, drainers move to TON and Bitcoin",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-drainers-sold-as-malware-at-it-conferences?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-04-23 08:05:00,What are spot Solana ETFs with staking? Canada’s crypto innovation explained,Cointelegraph,"What are spot Solana ETFs and why are they important?              A spot Solana ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds Solana (SOL) tokens directly, providing investors real-time exposure to the asset’s market price. Rather than using complex trading platforms or crypto wallets, you can access Solana via a regulated financial product traded on a traditional stock exchange. The value of Solana ETFs is directly tied to the open market price of SOL, offering a simple way to gain exposure to the blockchain’s performance without directly holding the asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs that use derivative contracts to speculate on Solana’s future prices, a spot ETF tracks the performance of the actual asset. This distinction is significant because futures products may face pricing inefficiencies, leading to performance mismatches over time. Spot ETFs are more transparent and directly reflect SOL's real-time supply and demand on the Solana blockchain.Spot Solana ETFs mark a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption. These products enable retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the Solana ecosystem while operating within the bounds of securities regulations.Like spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, spot Solana exchange-traded funds are expected to expand market access and serve as another entry point to decentralized finance (DeFi) for traditional investors.Did you know? Spot ETFs aim to mirror an asset’s current price by directly holding the asset, while futures ETFs use derivative contracts to speculate on future price movements.                  Launch of spot Solana ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange              On April 16, 2025, four spot Solana ETFs started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). With this, Canada became the first country to launch spot SOL ETFs with staking. The OSC granted approval to the spot Solana ETFs of four asset managers: 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve and CI Financial. Unlike products that only track Solana’s price, these funds hold SOL tokens, giving investors direct ownership of the asset. The funds are secured via institutional-grade cold storage custody. Each fund tracks a distinct Solana-related index, offering diverse strategies with onchain asset backing. Despite their structural differences, these ETFs are all designed for long-term investment, reflecting the issuers' strong belief in Solana's future in DeFi.By incorporating staking, these spot Solana ETFs provide an active way for investors to earn returns in the cryptocurrency market, all within a regulatory framework and secure, institutional-grade custody services.These ETFs enable staking through a partnership with TD Bank, allowing the SOL they hold to actively support and secure the Solana network. In return, the network issues staking rewards, which can be passed on to investors. Since Solana typically offers higher staking yields than Ethereum, this structure may translate into greater potential returns for investors.                  How does staking boost returns for  Solana ETF investors?              By offering staking, these spot Solana ETFs may boost returns for investors by an estimated 2%-3.5% annually, in addition to the performance of the underlying SOL. The ETFs generate yield by working with staking partners that delegate up to 50% of the fund’s assets for staking. Staking rewards generated by the ETF are typically shared between shareholders and the fund manager, with the specific allocation varying depending on the ETF issuer.Management fees of these spot Solana ETFs vary from 0.15% to 1%, with some providers offering fee waivers during the initial launch phase. After two days of trading, the combined assets under management for the four ETFs total about $73.5 million.Staking Solana may yield higher returns than staking Ether (ETH). The ETFs intend to pass these additional rewards on to investors, potentially reducing the long-term cost of owning the ETF.Here is a comparison between the various spot Solana ETFs with staking approved in Canada:Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest has incorporated staked Solana into its ARKW and ARKF ETFs, with both funds now holding shares of Canada’s 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ).Did you know? Altcoin ETFs track the prices of one or more cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). They diversify investor exposure within the cryptocurrency market, as various altcoins exhibit different price behaviors and underlying strengths.                  How Canada’s spot Solana ETFs unlock passive income opportunities              Canada offering spot Solana ETFs with staking is an innovative step. Existing SOL investment products, such as the crypto ETFs in Europe and the futures-based ETFs in the US do not offer an opportunity to earn staking yield.Incorporating yield into a regulated crypto ETF structure addresses a long-standing demand from investors and asset managers interested in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Solana and Ethereum. As staking is central to these tokens’ value, its inclusion enables SOL ETFs to offer a passive income component, making them more appealing to traditional investors seeking income-generating opportunities. The OSC’s approval of the staking feature for spot Solana ETFs may boost SOL’s position. However, staking carries risks, such as potential losses from validator penalties (slashing) or network disruptions, which could affect returns.Nonetheless, this approval reinforces Canada’s pioneering role in crypto ETF innovation, having launched the world’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2021, ahead of many other jurisdictions. By allowing staking rewards in spot Solana ETFs, Canadian regulators have signalled a growing acceptance of crypto-powered finance. Did you know? ETFs aren’t without risks. Market fluctuations can lead to losses, and tracking errors can cause an ETF'’s performance to differ from its benchmark index, affecting investor outcome.                  What Canada’s launch of Solana ETFs with staking means for pending SEC applications              Canada’s decision provides alternative cryptocurrency investment choices for its investors and may serve as an example for other countries considering spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.Despite a subdued global macroeconomic climate — partly shaped by trade tensions during Donald Trump’s presidency — Canada’s regulators have taken a proactive stance, embracing innovation in the digital asset space. The greenlighting of Solana ETFs with staking reflects a maturing approach to crypto policy and signals confidence in alternative layer-1 networks.Meanwhile, in the United States, anticipation is building. The launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on March 17, 2025, is seen as a stepping stone toward a US spot ETF. The SEC is currently reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications as of April 21, covering a spectrum of assets from major altcoins like XRP (XRP) to memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), including proposals for leveraged and derivative products.As of April 21, 2025, the SEC is reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications, including derivatives. The filings range from major cap altcoins to memecoins and include leveraged products and options. The outcome of Canada’s pioneering approach may offer valuable insights to regulators and could potentially influence the SEC’s decisions regarding these filings.However, the SEC’s stance may differ significantly from Canada’s due to structural and regulatory complexities within the US financial system. Unlike Canada's more unified regulatory framework, the US divides oversight between multiple agencies — including the SEC, CFTC, and state regulators — creating friction in crypto policymaking.Canada’s trailblazing move could nonetheless offer a valuable case study for US regulators. As markets await the SEC’s decisions, the key question remains whether Washington will follow Ottawa’s lead — or chart its own course and a slower timeline for non-Bitcoin spot ETFs.",https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-spot-solana-etfs-with-staking-canadas-crypto-innovation-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: 10x ResearchBitcoin was trading at $93,133 at the time of writing, up 11.42% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Thielen told Cointelegraph that stablecoin inflows “tend to correlate strongly with stickier money, while an increase in futures leverage could simply mean that fast traders are taking advantage of a quick move higher.” Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge, a true “demand-led rally”It comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US posted inflows of $912.7 million on April 22, the highest level since Jan. 17, according to Farside data.Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that the inflows suggest “this is a true, demand-led rally. Not just a hot flash of excited futures traders moving price.”“If the news headlines finally quieten, we could break new highs sooner than everyone thinks. A fast track to $100,000 looks plausible, but things change quickly in a Trump presidency.”Thielen said if uncertainty continues to decline, “a further acceleration could provide the liquidity needed to support a more sustained rally.”Related: Bitcoin risks 10%-15% BTC price dip after key rejection near $89KThe crypto market has experienced volatility and broader financial markets since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs in early February. However, Trump’s recent comments have traders speculating that he’s softening his stance on the trade war, with some seeing this as bullish for markets.Thielen said the $95,000 price level is a key resistance level for Bitcoin and a “potential trigger point for short-stop liquidations.”He said it could push Bitcoin’s price higher if market strength continues.Magazine: Former Love Island star’s tips on how to go viral in crypto: Van00sa, X Hall of FlameThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-04-23 03:09:57,SEC and feds charge man over $200M crypto trading scheme,Cointelegraph,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors have charged a man they allege created a crypto scheme that swindled 90,000 people out of $200 million in the hopes of earning returns from Bitcoin and forex trading.The SEC said on April 22 that it had charged Ramil Palafox, a dual citizen of the US and the Philippines, claiming he misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds gained through his company, PGI Global, between January 2020 and October 2021.The regulator alleged Palafox used a multilevel marketing model to execute a “Ponzi-like” scam until the company’s collapse in 2021. The SEC said he lured investors through “false claims of crypto industry expertise and a supposed AI-powered auto-trading platform.”The SEC claimed Palafox hosted lavish events in Dubai and Las Vegas to recruit new members who were offered referral bonuses to recruit others and used investor funds to pay other investors to further promote the scheme, as well as to line his own pockets.Excerpt from the SEC’s complaint against Ramil Palafox. Source: SEC“Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds,” said Scott Thompson, associate director of the SEC’s Philadelphia office. The SEC is charging Palafox with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and is seeking a permanent injunction to ban him from the future sale of securities and crypto assets, repayment of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. Justice Department files twin actionThe SEC’s complaint is running parallel to action brought by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which arraigned Ramil Palafox on criminal charges. According to an indictment filed under seal on March 13, federal prosecutors charged Palafox with wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions.Prosecutors alleged Palafox misled investors with false promises of daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 3% from Bitcoin trading and hid information about PGI’s profitability, licenses, and business activity. The indictment said Palafox told investors that substantial returns were being generated via the company’s crypto exchanges and that “his traders were able to make money regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin was going up or down.” However, the Justice Department alleged that, in reality, most investors' money was never used to buy or trade Bitcoin, and many lost some or all of their funds.Property listed in the indictment that would be forfeited by Palafox if convicted includes over $1 million in cash, 17 vehicles, including two Teslas, a Ferrari 458 Special, two Lamborghinis, and two Porsches, plus a variety of designer bags, wallets, shoes, jewellery and watches.Related: Crypto crime goes industrial as gangs launch coins, launder billions — UNVarious linked companies were included in the scheme, including the Praetorian Group International Trading Inc., the website for which was seized by the Department of Justice in 2021, leading to its UK-based operations being shut down by the UK’s High Court.  It’s the agency’s first crypto-related case under its crypto-friendly SEC chair, Paul Atkins, who was sworn in on April 22.The SEC had brought a case against Nova Labs in January, accusing it of selling unregistered securities by offering devices that mined the Helium (HNT) token. The SEC reached a settlement with Nova Labs in April that resulted in the lawsuit being dismissed and a $200,000 civil penalty.Magazine: Uni students crypto ‘grooming’ scandal, 67K scammed by fake women: Asia Express",https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-feds-lay-charges-200m-crypto-scheme?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-04-22 21:21:13,Bitcoin analysts target $95K as Trump’s trade war cools — Do BTC futures agree?,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a 45-day high above $91,000 on April 22, and the upward movement coincided with gold reaching a new all-time high. The price gains reflect investors' concerns over a potential economic recession amid ongoing global trade tensions.The tides are shifting, but does data support a Bitcoin price rally above $95,000?Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chIn neutral markets, the Bitcoin futures premium typically ranges between 5% and 10% to compensate for the longer settlement period. At present, the annualized premium stands at 6%, which is not considered particularly bullish, even though BTC appreciated by $6,840 between April 20 and April 22. Some analysts interpret this as a sign that Bitcoin is beginning to decouple from the stock market.Traders’ PTSD could emerge around BTC’s $90K zonePart of this skepticism among traders stems from Bitcoin’s repeated inability to sustain levels above $90,000 in early March. For example, Bitcoin tested the $95,000 mark on March 3, only to fall to $81,464 the following day. This inconsistent performance since the $109,346 peak on Jan. 20 has contributed to a lack of conviction among bullish investors, especially as gold has continued to set new all-time highs during the same period.S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphCurrently, Bitcoin is trading 16% below its all-time high, a figure that closely mirrors the S&P 500’s decline of 14.5%. This suggests that the recent era of excessive risk-taking may be behind us. Notably, even at its lowest point below $75,000, Bitcoin’s 32% drawdown was less severe than those experienced by Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (META), and Tesla (TSLA).Comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 22 contributed to easing investor concerns. As reported by Bloomberg, Bessent described the ongoing tariff standoff with China as “unsustainable,” suggesting an increased likelihood of de-escalation. In contrast, US President Donald Trump took to social media to assert that US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is hindering economic growth by not reducing interest rates.Bitcoin’s gains contrast with investors’ shift to government bondsRegardless of where the blame lies for the subdued economic growth in the United States, demand for short-term US Treasurys has risen, as evidenced by the yield on the 2-year note declining to 3.81% from 4.04% a month earlier. Essentially, investors are accepting lower returns in exchange for the perceived safety of government bonds. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s 6.3% price increase over the past 30 days stands out as particularly notable.To determine whether these recent gains have affected professional traders’ sentiment, it is important to examine the BTC options markets. If traders expect a correction, put (sell) options tend to trade at a premium, causing the 25% delta skew metric to rise above 6%. Conversely, bullish sentiment pushes the indicator below -6%.Bitcoin 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.chCurrently, the Bitcoin options market reflects limited enthusiasm following the recent surge to $91,000, with the 25% delta skew indicator at -2%, which remains within the neutral range. According to this metric, the last period of bullish sentiment occurred on Jan. 30, when Bitcoin traded near $105,000. Therefore, there is no clear evidence that large investors or market makers are anticipating a sustained rally above $95,000.Related: Institutional demand could push BTC past $200k in 2025 — AnalystsDespite some weak macroeconomic data, market participants expect a relatively strong first-quarter earnings season. FactSet reports that the “Magnificent 7” companies are projected to achieve earnings growth of 14.8% for the first quarter compared to the prior year.While Bitcoin still has a reasonable chance of revisiting $95,000 or higher, many traders appear to be waiting for further developments in the US-China trade war before placing additional bullish bets.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-04-22 20:09:44,"Bitcoin breaks downtrend with spike toward $92.6K, but who’s behind the price momentum?",Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin (BTC) price surged over the Easter weekend, jumping 9% and crossing the $91,000 threshold on April 22. This strong performance diverged sharply from the stock market’s lukewarm rebound and mirrored gold’s bullish behavior, which briefly touched a new all-time high of $3,500. While the BTC rally and its growing decoupling from equities are noteworthy, it's the derivatives market that offers an even more bullish signal.According to data from CoinGlass, Bitcoin open interest (OI) soared by 17%, reaching a 2-month high at $68.3. OI measures the total capital invested in BTC derivatives, and such an uptick shows a growing bullish sentiment among traders. The market is currently in contango — a situation where futures prices (notably CME Bitcoin futures) are higher than the spot price. This typically occurs because investors anticipate rising prices and take advantage of leverage tools offered by exchanges, allowing them to gain greater exposure through futures than they could with direct spot purchases.This raises two questions: Who is buying, and why?Institutional interest reawakensA key metric for understanding investor composition is the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. It measures the percentage price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro (BTC/USD) and Binance (BTC/USDT). Since Coinbase Pro caters predominantly to US-based institutional investors, while Binance has a broader global retail audience, this premium can indicate where the buying pressure is coming from.While the first half of April showed strong retail dominance, April 21–22 saw institutional demand kick in, with the Coinbase premium rising to 0.16%, per CoinGlass.Coinbase Bitcoin premium index. Source: CoinGlassMichael Saylor’s Strategy could be among those buyers. On April 21, Saylor announced the acquisition of 6,556 more BTC for approximately $555.8 million at an average price of ~$84,785 per coin. This brings MicroStrategy’s total holdings to an eye-watering 538,200 BTC, worth approximately $48.4 billion at current prices. On a smaller scale, Japan-based Metaplanet also added 330 BTC to its treasury, pushing its total to 4,855 BTC, the company’s CEO announced on the same day.Meanwhile, investors who favor traditional financial instruments over direct Bitcoin holding have also begun to renew their interest. According to the CoinGlass data, on April 21, BTC ETFs recorded $381 million in inflows — a much-needed reversal after a prolonged period of heavy outflows. Since February, ETFs had suffered 33 days of net outflows versus just 21 days of inflows, with outflows strongly dominating in volume. The recent reversal suggests renewed confidence, particularly from TradFi-aligned investors.Related: Bitcoin risks 10%-15% BTC price dip after key rejection near $89KThe dollar fades as Bitcoin rises Since tariff fears took grip of the market, institutional investors have kept Bitcoin and equities at arm’s length, but something shifted over the Easter weekend.Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin has decisively broken out of its multimonth downtrend“The multimonth downtrend is over. And when a technical downtrend is broken, technical uptrends emerge.”BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: Rekt CapitalAnother, more macroeconomic, factor may be the increasing tension between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Their growing rift, centered on concerns about inflationary pressure from tariffs and the Fed’s reluctance to cut rates, has cast a shadow over the US dollar.The US Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar’s value against a basket of currencies, has been in freefall since February, reaching lows last seen in 2022. Trump’s public pressure on Powell, and speculation that he might attempt to remove him or other Fed officials, is fueling anxiety over the Fed’s independence — a foundational pillar of the US financial system. The potential consequences of a falling dollar for the global economy are difficult to predict, but one thing is clear: Bitcoin stands poised to be a major beneficiary. A decentralized, censorship-resistant money governed solely by code, with a fixed supply schedule and no central authority to manipulate its issuance. As confidence in traditional monetary systems continues to erode, Bitcoin’s narrative grows ever stronger.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-04-22 15:10:00,Crocodilus malware explained: how it targets android crypto wallets,Cointelegraph,"What is Crocodilus malware?              Crocodilus is the latest in a string of Android crypto malware built to steal your cryptoassets.Crocodilus is a sophisticated piece of malware that steals digital assets from Android devices. Named after crocodile references scattered throughout its code, Crocodilus targets Android 13 devices or later. The Android wallet malware utilizes overlays, remote access and social engineering to take over your device and drain your crypto wallet. Fraud prevention firm Threat Fabric discovered Crocodilus malware in March 2025 and published detailed research on the new virus. As of April 2025, users in Spain and Turkey are the primary targets. Threat Fabric predicts Crocodilus will expand globally in the coming months.                                     How Crocodilus infects Android devices              Crocodilus’ primary method of infection is still unknown, but it likely follows a path similar to other malware.What sets Crocodilus apart from typical crypto wallet malware is how deeply it integrates with your device. It does more than just trick you via social engineering. It takes complete control of your Android.While the leading cause of infection is unknown, malware like this often appears in a few ways:Fake apps: Crocodilus may disguise itself as a legitimate cryptocurrency-related app on the Google Play Store or on third-party app-hosting sites. Threat Fabric says the malware can bypass the Google Play Store’s safety scanners.SMS promotions: SMS scams are increasingly common. If you receive a random text with a suspicious link, don’t click on it. It may redirect you to a page that downloads malware.Malicious advertising: Infected ads run rampant on adult or software piracy websites. Each ad is strategically placed to make you accidentally tap, and it only takes one tap to download malware.  Phishing attempts: Some malware campaigns send malicious phishing emails that impersonate cryptocurrency exchanges. Double-check the sender’s e-mail address to verify its legitimacy.Once Crocodilus infects your device, the malware will request accessibility service permissions. Accepting these permissions connects Crocodilus to its command-and-control (C2) server, where attackers can display screen overlays, track keystrokes or activate remote access to control your device.However, the malware’s main identifying trait is its wallet backup trick. If you log into your cryptocurrency wallet app using a password or PIN, Crocodilus displays a fake overlay. It reads: “Back up your wallet key in the settings within 12 hours. Otherwise, the app will be reset, and you may lose access to your wallet.” If you click “continue,” Crocodilus prompts you to type in your seed phrase. The malware tracks your inputs via its keylogger. Then, the attackers have everything they need to steal your assets.Crocodilus’ fake overlay imitates legitimate wallet software. Its “continue” button is easy to press without thinking, but know that a recognizable wallet app would never urge you to back up your wallet in this way. If you see this overlay, uninstall the app and consider a clean install of your device.Unfortunately, keylogging is just the start. Crocodilus circumvents two-factor authentication (2FA) processes via its screen recorder, capturing verification codes from apps like Google Authenticator and sending them to C2.  Worst of all, Crocodilus displays a black overlay and mutes your device’s audio to cover up its activities. It pretends your phone is locked while silently stealing your assets in the background. The malware can conduct 45 commands in total, including:SMS takeover: Crocodilus can retrieve your text messages, text your contacts list, and even make itself your default SMS app.Remote access: The malware takes complete control of your device, allowing it to open apps, activate your camera or start your screen recorder.Modify text: While Crocodilus tricks you into inputting your wallet information, it can alter or generate text to help C2 access your private apps using data it finds on your device.Did you know? Stealthy malware threats to crypto wallets are common. Zero-click attacks — malware that infects your device without any input from you — are another form of crypto malware in 2025.                  What if you’ve fallen victim to a Crocodilus attack?              Falling victim to Crocodilus requires immediate action.If you’ve fallen victim to the Android Trojan Crocodilus, immediately follow these crypto wallet protection tips:Isolate your device: Disconnect your device from Wi-Fi or data and turn it off. Remove the battery if possible.Recover your assets: You should have your wallet’s seed phrase stored in a safe, physical location. Use it to recover your wallet to an uncompromised device.Get rid of your infected device: Unfortunately, using your infected device is a massive risk. Factory resetting it might not get rid of the malware. Moving to another device is your safest option.Report the threat: If you downloaded a malicious app, such as one from the Google Play Store, report it to the relevant parties.Did you know? If you lose your cryptoassets, there’s no getting them back. Some may consider this one of the downsides to decentralization — a lack of a central authority to monitor and insure theft.                  How to check for a Crocodilus attack              Regular checks go a long way toward protecting your cryptocurrencies. Learn how to detect crypto malware.While Crocodilus manipulates your device in secret, there are some telltale signs of infection to watch out for. Here’s how to protect crypto on Android if you’re suspicious of a Crocodilus attack:Suspicious app activity: Check your device activity tracker. An unaccounted-for uptick in cryptocurrency or banking apps may be cause for concern.Check app permissions: Regularly review the app permissions you've allowed, especially those that request accessibility permissions. Increased battery drain: A small but significant sign of infection is increased battery drain. If your battery drains faster than usual, your phone may be running malware in the background. Data usage spikes: Crocodilus continually transmits data to its C2 server. Monitor your data usage and be aware of any sudden increases. This is one of the most apparent signs your wallet app is compromised.                  How to prevent a Crocodilus hack              Prevention is the best form of protection.According to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, an estimated $51 billion in cryptocurrencies was stolen via crypto hacks in 2024. The group expects this number to increase in 2025 and beyond. Cybersecurity is more important than ever as we continue to move toward decentralized digital finance.While it’s impossible to remain 100% safe from cyberthreats, consider adopting the following behaviors to protect yourself. Crypto wallet security in 2025 is more important than ever:Browse safely: Avoid suspicious websites that exist to trap users into downloading Crocodilus and other malware stealing crypto keys.Use a hardware wallet: As of April 2025, Crocodilus targets Android devices, specifically.

Oregon AG lawsuit against Coinbase calls XRP unregistered securityOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s lawsuit against Coinbase argues that XRP and other digital assets are unregistered securities.Rayield sued US-based, publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly violating Oregon’s securities law. In an April 18 announcement, the Oregon Department of Justice said the suit was part of an effort to fill what it described as a regulatory vacuum left by federal agencies under the Trump administration:“States must fill enforcement vacuum being left by federal regulators who are abandoning these cases under Trump administration,“ the department said.Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal voiced his frustration over the lawsuit in an April 21 X post. Justin Slaughter, the vice president of regulatory affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, pointed out that the lawsuit claims a long list of digital assets, including XRP (XRP), are unregistered securities.Source: Paul GrewalYarden Noy, partner at crypto legal firm DLT Law, told Cointelegraph that if the court ruled these assets are securities, it “would mostly create more confusion in this regard.” It would not be a binding precedent in other cases, not even within Oregon, he added.Paul Atkins, nominated by Trump, sworn in as SEC chairPaul Atkins has officially been sworn in as the 34th chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The April 21 announcement comes nearly two weeks after Atkins’ position was confirmed by the US Senate in a 52-44 vote on April 9.Source: US House Committee on Financial Services Republicans“I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,” said Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008.Atkins is widely expected to lead a more crypto-friendly SEC than former chair Gary Gensler under the Biden administration.Consensys, Solana, Uniswap CEO donated to Trump's $239 million inauguration fundNew filings from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) reveal that several cryptocurrency firms and their executives made significant contributions to US President Donald Trump’s inauguration fund after the results of the 2024 election. According to FEC filings made public on April 20 by the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams donated more than $245,000, Solana Labs donated $1 million, and software firm Consensys sent $100,000 in January to support the then-president-elect’s inauguration. Many major crypto firms had previously announced their support of Trump through donations to the inaugural fund, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Kraken, Ondo Finance, and Robinhood.Altogether, the fund reported more than $239 million in net donations between Nov. 15 and April 20 from companies and individuals. These included $1 million from McDonald’s, $1 million from Meta, $1 million from Apple CEO Tim Cook, $1 million from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and various contributions from Delta Air Lines, ExxonMobil, FedEx, Nvidia, PayPal, Target, and Coca-Cola. Jan. 9 contribution from Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams to Trump-Vance inauguration fund.

2025-04-22 12:17:08,A guide to crypto trading bots: Analyzing strategies and performance,Cointelegraph,"The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a surge in the adoption of automated trading solutions, with trading bots gaining prominence for their ability to analyze vast data sets and execute trades with precision.Cointelegraph has dissected historical bot revenues and token price rollercoasters and backtested strategy returns against the buy-and-hold yardstick to decode what bots shine brightest — and when — so you can pick the perfect bot to match your style and stomach for risk.We have examined three types of trading bots: Telegram bots trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX), non-Telegram bots trading on DEXs and on centralized exchanges (CEXs), and the recently evolving AI agent bots.Choosing the right trading bot depends on the user’s goals, risk tolerance and experience. At a glance:Telegram bots are ideal for fast, opportunistic trading like token launches and memecoins.AI agent bots, such as ai16z or Virtuals, suit users who want hands-off automation and are comfortable with experimental strategies.CEX bots offer the most control and are best for structured strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA), grid or signal-based trading.Bot trading strategies and performanceTrading bots are sophisticated automated systems that use algorithms to analyze cryptocurrency market data and autonomously execute trades on centralized exchanges or decentralized platforms. These bots typically operate continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, requiring minimal human oversight. Their core function involves the analysis of extensive amounts of real-time and historical market data, including price fluctuations, trading volumes and order book information. There are numerous potential advantages to employing AI agent trading bots. Their continuous operation ensures that no trading opportunities are missed, as they can monitor markets around the clock, accommodating global market movements. Some platforms offering these bots also provide backtesting capabilities, enabling users to evaluate the potential effectiveness of different trading strategies using historical data before deploying them with real capital.Telegram DEX bots Telegram bots operate via Telegram, leveraging its accessibility and real-time communication to execute trades directly on DEXs. They often focus on speed and sniping new tokens, appealing to users in fast-moving ecosystems like Solana. The recently launched protocols also included additional features that are often available in CEX trading bots, such as grid trading, DCA and limit orders.Telegram bots such as Maestro and Unibot first appeared around 2020–2021. In 2022, many of these bots were already offering advanced features like copy trading and arbitrage.By the end of 2023, Solana-based bots like BONKBot and Trojan Bot gained prominence for their speed in trading memecoins on DEXs. The biggest advantage of Telegram bots is their ability to trade on mobile devices without the need for a web browser extension to connect to a wallet. It hugely improves the usability of mobile trading, monitoring and integration with social networks.The top five Telegram bots by historical trading volume across all blockchains are Trojan, BonkBot, Maestro, Banana Gun and Sol Trading Bot. The majority of the trading volumes in the past 90 days happened on Solana, where all of the top five Telegram bots operate.DEX trading bot wars. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe functionalities offered by the Telegram bots are very similar, with the exception that some of them (i.e., Maestro and Banana Gun) focus on multichain operations, whereas the rest focus on Solana.The main use case for Telegram bots is to automatically identify profitable entry and exit points and execute trades quickly; it’s very difficult to track the profits or losses made by individual users from each trade. Since some of the Telegram bots, such as Banana Gun and BonkBot, offer a revenue-sharing model tied to their own tokens in the form of purchasing back their tokens with the 1% fee they charge, the token price and revenue (fees received) are used as an approximation of the performance of Telegram bots.Daily revenue in USD among Telegram bots.

Looking at the price evolution in the past six months, the performance of the remaining parts is very similar, except for the significant rise in BONK’s price in November 2024. They both experienced significant price drops during the recent bearish market conditions.Related: The whale, the hack and the psychological earthquake that hit HEXAI agent bots AI agent trading bots are sophisticated automated systems that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze cryptocurrency market data and autonomously execute trades.The term “agent” suggests these bots possess a degree of independence and decision-making capability that extends beyond the fixed rules of traditional automated trading systems. The most well-known AI agent frameworks that exist today are Virtuals and ai16z.Virtuals Protocol, launched in October 2024 on the Ethereum layer-2 network Base, is an AI agent generator platform designed to simplify the creation and deployment of AI agents on the blockchain. While Virtuals is not solely focused on trading, the platform enables the development of AI agents that could potentially be designed for trading purposes. For instance, Aixbt, an experimental AI agent on the platform, tracks discussions on X to identify potential market insights, suggesting a strategy that could inform trading decisions.Since Virtuals Protocol focuses on a launchpad model where agents are tokenized individually (e.g., LUNA and AIXBT) and operate across different areas such as gaming, trading and entertainment, we’ll only look into the performance of AIXBT, the token of the trading agent with the largest market capitalization on Virtuals.AIXBT price history. Source: CoinMarketCapAi16z is an AI-powered trading fund operating on the Solana blockchain. Launched in October 2024, ai16z utilizes sophisticated AI agents, powered by the Eliza framework, to autonomously analyze market data, including price movements, social media sentiment and onchain analytics, and execute trades.The fund functions as an AI investment decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allowing holders of its native token to participate in governance by voting on key decisions and influencing trading strategies through a “virtual marketplace of trust.” AI Marc, a virtual fund manager built using the Eliza framework, oversees the fund’s trading activities. AI16Z tokens represent ownership in the fund and grant governance rights, with the agent’s actions driving token value. AI16Z price history. Source: CoinMarketCapComparing the trading volumes from these two agents, they both reached a peak in January 2025, with AI16Z reaching $501 million and AIXBT reaching $682 million. AI16Z’s price hit its peak slightly earlier than its volume high, whereas for AIXBT, the price and volume peaks coincided around the same time.AI16Z and AIXBT price and volume comparison. Source: CoinMarketCapAIXBT’s price performance is more impressive than AI16Z. At the peak, the token price was almost 4,000x the initial price in November 2024, whereas for AI16Z, this was around 111x. Even after the recent downturn and the broader market trending down, the latest price record at the end of March 2025 is still 478x the initial price for AIXBT and 6.8x for AI16Z.DEX/CEX bots These platforms are web-based and operate outside Telegram. You can trade directly on DEXs through wallet connection or connect to a CEX via APIs or a simple login option as part of their integrated exchange solutions.These web-based platforms offer a wide range of strategies and broader market access; they cater to users preferring both CEX liquidity and reliability as well as DEX’s decentralized, non-custodial nature. Some of these platforms also offer a quick switch between DEX and CEX with one click, making the discovery of price discrepancies between CEX and DEX (or CEX-DEX arbitrage) much easier.The most common strategies available on these platforms are grid, DCA and signal bot. A DCA bot invests a fixed amount of money into a cryptocurrency at regular intervals — regardless of the asset’s price. The idea is to spread out your entry points over time, which helps reduce the impact of market volatility. This type of strategy tends to perform well during price-trending periods.A grid bot is built for active trading — buying low and selling high in a structured way to profit from price fluctuations. A grid bot places a series of buy and sell limit orders at preset intervals above and below a set price range. This creates a “grid” of orders, and the bot profits from each completed buy-low/sell-high cycle. Grid bot works best in sideways markets with high volatility.A signal bot executes trades based on external signals — these usually come from technical indicators, market analysis or third-party services. These signals can be relative strength index (RSI), exponential moving averages (EMA), Bollinger Bands, etc.The following table shows the historical performance for the token pairs BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT and SOL/USDT for the three trading strategies. The parameter selection for the grid bot utilizes the 3Commas AI optimization built-in functionality to select the best parameters, whereas for DCA, the most popular classic trading strategy from their users is selected. For the signal bot, Dash2Trade provides strategy presets where the top strategy for each token is selected. These strategies are backtested on a proprietary system used to trade on live markets but are only available for the 120 days before Jan. 26, 2025.Due to a lack of consistent availability of data on the platforms, three backtesting periods were used for each of the three strategies. The table below shows the simple price change during the corresponding period, which is also the return for the simple benchmark buy-and-hold strategy.The available data suggests that performance can vary widely based on the specific bot, the trading strategy employed and the prevailing market conditions at the time the backtests were run. BTC and ETH price. Source: CoinMarketCapDuring the 120-day period from Sept. 26, 2024, to Jan. 26, 2025, when the signal bots were backtested, the market prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) were all upward trending with a buy-and-hold return of 58%, 23% and 55%, respectively. The signal bots’ strategies were performing in line with the buy-and-hold strategy (in some cases slightly worse) for BTC (58.15%), ETH (16.79%) and SOL (48.68%). Comparing the same 120-day period but from Dec. 4, 2024, to April 4, 2025, when grid bots were backtested, the market prices for BTC, ETH and SOL were all experiencing a downward trend, with a buy-and-hold return of -16%, -53% and -49%, respectively, which is completely different from the previous 120-day backtesting period. The grid bots’ strategies were performing much better than the buy-and-hold strategy during the downward-trending, high-volatility market conditions, giving positive returns for BTC (9.6%), ETH (10.4%) and SOL (21.88%).BTC and SOL price. Source: CoinMarketCapFor the longest 180-day backtesting period from Oct. 4, 2024, to April 4, 2025, when the DCA bots were backtested, the buy-and-hold returns for BTC, ETH and SOL were 34%, -25% and -18%, respectively. The signal bots’ strategies were performing very differently for the three tokens compared to the buy-and-hold strategy. For BTC, a 17.75% return is generated from the DCA bots, which is worse than the buy-and-hold strategy. However, for ETH (58.12%) and SOL (80.92%), the DCA returns are much better than the buy-and-hold returns. This might be due to the fact that ETH and SOL experienced much higher volatility during the period compared to BTC, and the DCA strategy was able to spread out entry prices to reduce exposure to bad timing.Related: Market maker deals are quietly killing crypto projectsTrading bot performance comparisonTelegram DEX bots like Trojan and Sol Trading Bot dominated in revenue over the past six months, with Trojan earning about $109 million in fees. Sol Trading Bot stood out for consistent daily earnings relative to its size.However, all bots saw revenue peak during the January 2025 memecoin hype and have since slowed due to bearish market sentiment. Token-linked bots (BANANA, BONK) followed a similar pattern — brief surges (notably BONK in November 2024) followed by steep drops tied to broader market trends.AI agent bots showed explosive growth during the same period. AIXBT reached a peak price 4,000x its initial value, far outperforming AI16Z (111x). Even post-correction, AIXBT held strong at 478x vs. AI16Z’s 6.8x. Volume-wise, both peaked in January 2025, but AIXBT’s token price closely tracked its volume rise, suggesting strong speculative momentum.CEX/DEX signals, grid and DCA bots showed the importance of market conditions, and the performance results vary quite a lot compared to the buy-and-hold strategy.Signal bots performed close to the buy-and-hold strategy during the uptrend market condition (backtesting period September 2024–January 2025), with marginally lower or similar returns.Grid bots excelled during a downtrend and high volatility environment (backtesting period December 2024–April 2025), beating the buy-and-hold strategy by wide margins, flipping negative market returns into double-digit gains.DCA bots over a 180-day backtesting period (October 2024–April 2025) had mixed results; they underperformed the buy-and-hold strategy for BTC but dramatically outperformed ETH and SOL, most likely due to their ability to absorb and capitalize on volatility.Key takeawaysWe have dived into the wild world of AI-powered crypto trading bots, pitting Telegram DEX bots, AI agent bots and CEX/DEX bots against each other — each a unique tool tailored to different traders and market conditions.Telegram DEX bots are designed for ease of use, with a simple interface embedded in the Telegram app. These bots focus on trading memecoins or participating in token launches onchain. They appeal to mobile-savvy traders and memecoin enthusiasts who prioritize quick trades and social integration, with features such as copy trade and revenue-sharing through tokens.Telegram DEX bots generated significant revenue in the past six months, peaking in January 2025’s memecoin season. But not all of them share revenue with the users. The only two who did (BANANA, BONK) faltered in the recent bearish market, with token prices dropping sharply. AI agent bots use natural language interfaces and AI decision-making to lower the barrier to entry for users interested in governance (e.g., AI16Z’s DAO model) or sentiment-driven strategies (e.g., AIXBT’s X analysis). Their primary strength lies in abstracting complex trading strategies through conversational interfaces.Although AI agent bots’ token price exhibited explosive growth, the recent market downtrend has led to less trading activity and lower token prices. AI agent bots stand out as a more experimental category. They remain under development and are best suited for users who are tech-curious or seeking a hybrid between simplicity and automation.Bots operating on DEXs or CEXs directly offer web-based platforms with diverse strategies, suiting more experienced traders who need high-speed execution, multi-exchange access, deep liquidity and complex configurability.

At a glance:Telegram bots are ideal for fast, opportunistic trading like token launches and memecoins.AI agent bots, such as ai16z or Virtuals, suit users who want hands-off automation and are comfortable with experimental strategies.CEX bots offer the most control and are best for structured strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA), grid or signal-based trading.Bot trading strategies and performanceTrading bots are sophisticated automated systems that use algorithms to analyze cryptocurrency market data and autonomously execute trades on centralized exchanges or decentralized platforms. These bots typically operate continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, requiring minimal human oversight. Their core function involves the analysis of extensive amounts of real-time and historical market data, including price fluctuations, trading volumes and order book information. There are numerous potential advantages to employing AI agent trading bots. Their continuous operation ensures that no trading opportunities are missed, as they can monitor markets around the clock, accommodating global market movements. Some platforms offering these bots also provide backtesting capabilities, enabling users to evaluate the potential effectiveness of different trading strategies using historical data before deploying them with real capital.Telegram DEX bots Telegram bots operate via Telegram, leveraging its accessibility and real-time communication to execute trades directly on DEXs. They often focus on speed and sniping new tokens, appealing to users in fast-moving ecosystems like Solana. The recently launched protocols also included additional features that are often available in CEX trading bots, such as grid trading, DCA and limit orders.Telegram bots such as Maestro and Unibot first appeared around 2020–2021. In 2022, many of these bots were already offering advanced features like copy trading and arbitrage.By the end of 2023, Solana-based bots like BONKBot and Trojan Bot gained prominence for their speed in trading memecoins on DEXs. The biggest advantage of Telegram bots is their ability to trade on mobile devices without the need for a web browser extension to connect to a wallet. It hugely improves the usability of mobile trading, monitoring and integration with social networks.The top five Telegram bots by historical trading volume across all blockchains are Trojan, BonkBot, Maestro, Banana Gun and Sol Trading Bot. The majority of the trading volumes in the past 90 days happened on Solana, where all of the top five Telegram bots operate.DEX trading bot wars. Source: Dune AnalyticsThe functionalities offered by the Telegram bots are very similar, with the exception that some of them (i.e., Maestro and Banana Gun) focus on multichain operations, whereas the rest focus on Solana.The main use case for Telegram bots is to automatically identify profitable entry and exit points and execute trades quickly; it’s very difficult to track the profits or losses made by individual users from each trade. Since some of the Telegram bots, such as Banana Gun and BonkBot, offer a revenue-sharing model tied to their own tokens in the form of purchasing back their tokens with the 1% fee they charge, the token price and revenue (fees received) are used as an approximation of the performance of Telegram bots.Daily revenue in USD among Telegram bots.

Looking at the price evolution in the past six months, the performance of the remaining parts is very similar, except for the significant rise in BONK’s price in November 2024. They both experienced significant price drops during the recent bearish market conditions.Related: The whale, the hack and the psychological earthquake that hit HEXAI agent bots AI agent trading bots are sophisticated automated systems that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze cryptocurrency market data and autonomously execute trades.The term “agent” suggests these bots possess a degree of independence and decision-making capability that extends beyond the fixed rules of traditional automated trading systems. The most well-known AI agent frameworks that exist today are Virtuals and ai16z.Virtuals Protocol, launched in October 2024 on the Ethereum layer-2 network Base, is an AI agent generator platform designed to simplify the creation and deployment of AI agents on the blockchain. While Virtuals is not solely focused on trading, the platform enables the development of AI agents that could potentially be designed for trading purposes. For instance, Aixbt, an experimental AI agent on the platform, tracks discussions on X to identify potential market insights, suggesting a strategy that could inform trading decisions.Since Virtuals Protocol focuses on a launchpad model where agents are tokenized individually (e.g., LUNA and AIXBT) and operate across different areas such as gaming, trading and entertainment, we’ll only look into the performance of AIXBT, the token of the trading agent with the largest market capitalization on Virtuals.AIXBT price history. Source: CoinMarketCapAi16z is an AI-powered trading fund operating on the Solana blockchain. Launched in October 2024, ai16z utilizes sophisticated AI agents, powered by the Eliza framework, to autonomously analyze market data, including price movements, social media sentiment and onchain analytics, and execute trades.The fund functions as an AI investment decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allowing holders of its native token to participate in governance by voting on key decisions and influencing trading strategies through a “virtual marketplace of trust.” AI Marc, a virtual fund manager built using the Eliza framework, oversees the fund’s trading activities. AI16Z tokens represent ownership in the fund and grant governance rights, with the agent’s actions driving token value. AI16Z price history.

AI16Z’s price hit its peak slightly earlier than its volume high, whereas for AIXBT, the price and volume peaks coincided around the same time.AI16Z and AIXBT price and volume comparison. Source: CoinMarketCapAIXBT’s price performance is more impressive than AI16Z. At the peak, the token price was almost 4,000x the initial price in November 2024, whereas for AI16Z, this was around 111x. Even after the recent downturn and the broader market trending down, the latest price record at the end of March 2025 is still 478x the initial price for AIXBT and 6.8x for AI16Z.DEX/CEX bots These platforms are web-based and operate outside Telegram. You can trade directly on DEXs through wallet connection or connect to a CEX via APIs or a simple login option as part of their integrated exchange solutions.These web-based platforms offer a wide range of strategies and broader market access; they cater to users preferring both CEX liquidity and reliability as well as DEX’s decentralized, non-custodial nature. Some of these platforms also offer a quick switch between DEX and CEX with one click, making the discovery of price discrepancies between CEX and DEX (or CEX-DEX arbitrage) much easier.The most common strategies available on these platforms are grid, DCA and signal bot. A DCA bot invests a fixed amount of money into a cryptocurrency at regular intervals — regardless of the asset’s price. The idea is to spread out your entry points over time, which helps reduce the impact of market volatility. This type of strategy tends to perform well during price-trending periods.A grid bot is built for active trading — buying low and selling high in a structured way to profit from price fluctuations. A grid bot places a series of buy and sell limit orders at preset intervals above and below a set price range. This creates a “grid” of orders, and the bot profits from each completed buy-low/sell-high cycle. Grid bot works best in sideways markets with high volatility.A signal bot executes trades based on external signals — these usually come from technical indicators, market analysis or third-party services. These signals can be relative strength index (RSI), exponential moving averages (EMA), Bollinger Bands, etc.The following table shows the historical performance for the token pairs BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT and SOL/USDT for the three trading strategies. The parameter selection for the grid bot utilizes the 3Commas AI optimization built-in functionality to select the best parameters, whereas for DCA, the most popular classic trading strategy from their users is selected. For the signal bot, Dash2Trade provides strategy presets where the top strategy for each token is selected. These strategies are backtested on a proprietary system used to trade on live markets but are only available for the 120 days before Jan. 26, 2025.Due to a lack of consistent availability of data on the platforms, three backtesting periods were used for each of the three strategies. The table below shows the simple price change during the corresponding period, which is also the return for the simple benchmark buy-and-hold strategy.The available data suggests that performance can vary widely based on the specific bot, the trading strategy employed and the prevailing market conditions at the time the backtests were run. BTC and ETH price. Source: CoinMarketCapDuring the 120-day period from Sept. 26, 2024, to Jan. 26, 2025, when the signal bots were backtested, the market prices for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) were all upward trending with a buy-and-hold return of 58%, 23% and 55%, respectively. The signal bots’ strategies were performing in line with the buy-and-hold strategy (in some cases slightly worse) for BTC (58.15%), ETH (16.79%) and SOL (48.68%). Comparing the same 120-day period but from Dec. 4, 2024, to April 4, 2025, when grid bots were backtested, the market prices for BTC, ETH and SOL were all experiencing a downward trend, with a buy-and-hold return of -16%, -53% and -49%, respectively, which is completely different from the previous 120-day backtesting period. The grid bots’ strategies were performing much better than the buy-and-hold strategy during the downward-trending, high-volatility market conditions, giving positive returns for BTC (9.6%), ETH (10.4%) and SOL (21.88%).BTC and SOL price. Source: CoinMarketCapFor the longest 180-day backtesting period from Oct. 4, 2024, to April 4, 2025, when the DCA bots were backtested, the buy-and-hold returns for BTC, ETH and SOL were 34%, -25% and -18%, respectively. The signal bots’ strategies were performing very differently for the three tokens compared to the buy-and-hold strategy. For BTC, a 17.75% return is generated from the DCA bots, which is worse than the buy-and-hold strategy. However, for ETH (58.12%) and SOL (80.92%), the DCA returns are much better than the buy-and-hold returns. This might be due to the fact that ETH and SOL experienced much higher volatility during the period compared to BTC, and the DCA strategy was able to spread out entry prices to reduce exposure to bad timing.Related: Market maker deals are quietly killing crypto projectsTrading bot performance comparisonTelegram DEX bots like Trojan and Sol Trading Bot dominated in revenue over the past six months, with Trojan earning about $109 million in fees. Sol Trading Bot stood out for consistent daily earnings relative to its size.However, all bots saw revenue peak during the January 2025 memecoin hype and have since slowed due to bearish market sentiment. Token-linked bots (BANANA, BONK) followed a similar pattern — brief surges (notably BONK in November 2024) followed by steep drops tied to broader market trends.AI agent bots showed explosive growth during the same period. AIXBT reached a peak price 4,000x its initial value, far outperforming AI16Z (111x). Even post-correction, AIXBT held strong at 478x vs. AI16Z’s 6.8x. Volume-wise, both peaked in January 2025, but AIXBT’s token price closely tracked its volume rise, suggesting strong speculative momentum.CEX/DEX signals, grid and DCA bots showed the importance of market conditions, and the performance results vary quite a lot compared to the buy-and-hold strategy.Signal bots performed close to the buy-and-hold strategy during the uptrend market condition (backtesting period September 2024–January 2025), with marginally lower or similar returns.Grid bots excelled during a downtrend and high volatility environment (backtesting period December 2024–April 2025), beating the buy-and-hold strategy by wide margins, flipping negative market returns into double-digit gains.DCA bots over a 180-day backtesting period (October 2024–April 2025) had mixed results; they underperformed the buy-and-hold strategy for BTC but dramatically outperformed ETH and SOL, most likely due to their ability to absorb and capitalize on volatility.Key takeawaysWe have dived into the wild world of AI-powered crypto trading bots, pitting Telegram DEX bots, AI agent bots and CEX/DEX bots against each other — each a unique tool tailored to different traders and market conditions.Telegram DEX bots are designed for ease of use, with a simple interface embedded in the Telegram app. These bots focus on trading memecoins or participating in token launches onchain. They appeal to mobile-savvy traders and memecoin enthusiasts who prioritize quick trades and social integration, with features such as copy trade and revenue-sharing through tokens.Telegram DEX bots generated significant revenue in the past six months, peaking in January 2025’s memecoin season. But not all of them share revenue with the users. The only two who did (BANANA, BONK) faltered in the recent bearish market, with token prices dropping sharply. AI agent bots use natural language interfaces and AI decision-making to lower the barrier to entry for users interested in governance (e.g., AI16Z’s DAO model) or sentiment-driven strategies (e.g., AIXBT’s X analysis). Their primary strength lies in abstracting complex trading strategies through conversational interfaces.Although AI agent bots’ token price exhibited explosive growth, the recent market downtrend has led to less trading activity and lower token prices. AI agent bots stand out as a more experimental category. They remain under development and are best suited for users who are tech-curious or seeking a hybrid between simplicity and automation.Bots operating on DEXs or CEXs directly offer web-based platforms with diverse strategies, suiting more experienced traders who need high-speed execution, multi-exchange access, deep liquidity and complex configurability. The backtesting results show signal bots give similar returns to the bullish buy-and-hold strategy, whereas grid bots thrive in volatile downturn markets, and DCA bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy for more volatile assets.Magazine: Your AI ‘digital twin’ can take meetings and comfort your loved ones",https://cointelegraph.com/news/guide-crypto-trading-bots-strategies-performance?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
