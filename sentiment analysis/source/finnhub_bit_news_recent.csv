2025-04-30 03:48:59,Strategy’s Bitcoin buys should be ‘super careless’ to pump price — Exec,Cointelegraph,"Key takeaways:Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor’s Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders.Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.“Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.Strategy should try “super aggressive” buyingHowever, Byworth pondered what happens when Bitcoin (BTC) reaches an “illiquid supply” point where no Bitcoin is left on crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks.“Should Saylor buy Bitcoin really carelessly? As in, not try and buy it through OTC desks…and actually just buy it with the intention of massively ramping the price,” Byworth said.“The point where things are getting less liquid, maybe you should try for a period going super aggressive, super careless buying, market impact all across, and push the price higher.”Strategy currently holds 553,555 BTC, valued at approximately $52.48 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. Fidelity Digital Assets said on April 24 that it has seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to purchases by public companies, which it anticipated would accelerate “in the near future.” Byworth said a firm like Strategy wouldn’t be concerned with the price of Bitcoin when buying it as its primary focus would be on its mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value), the value of the assets held, as “it is much more beneficial to [its] shareholders.”Richard Byworth spoke to Bram Kanstein on the Bitcoin for Millennials podcast. Source: Bram KansteinHe added that when there is no more Bitcoin, “you may as well go aggressive buying, because what happens is it will just ramp the price, it will massively increase [Strategy’s] MNAV, which means [its] dilution will become much more accretive.”Movements in the NAV premium and discount can give signals about market sentiment or potential future price movements.Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May — Here is whyByworth said that Japan has a “large number of zombie companies” holding significant cash reserves. He proposed that Strategy could adopt an aggressive approach by acquiring these companies and “immediately converting that cash into Bitcoin,” similar to the strategy taken by Japanese investment firm Metaplanet.“There are plenty of companies out there in Japan like that, sitting on these cash flow generative businesses that are pretty boring and have very low price-to-cash ratios,” Byworth added.On April 21, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than $400 million after its latest $28 million purchase.Bitcoin is trading at $94,680 at the time of publication.

2025-04-30 02:24:37,Australia’s finance watchdog to crack down on dormant crypto exchanges,Cointelegraph,"Australia’s financial intelligence agency has told inactive registered crypto exchanges to withdraw their registrations or risk having them canceled over fears that the dormant firms could be used for scams.There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”“Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided,” he added.AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas says scammers can use inactive crypto firms to appear legitimate. Source: AUSTRACBusinesses wanting to offer Australians conversions between cash and crypto, including crypto ATM providers, must first register with AUSTRAC, which monitors for crimes including money laundering, terror financing and tax evasion.The agency can cancel a registration if it has reasonable grounds to believe the business is no longer active or offering crypto-related services.Ten firms have had their AUSTRAC registration canceled since 2019, with the most recent being FTX Express in June 2024, the local subsidiary of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX.AUSTRAC to launch public list of registered exchanges Following its blitz on inactive crypto exchanges, AUSTRAC said it will publish a list of registered exchanges to help Australians verify legitimate providers.Thomas said the goal is to make it harder for criminals to scam people and improve the integrity and accuracy of AUSTRAC's register.“If a DCE does intend to offer a service, they need to contact us otherwise we will cancel the registration and this information will be added to the register,” he said.“Members of the public should feel confident that they can identify legitimate cryptocurrency providers that are registered and subject to regulatory oversight and that we are driving criminals out of this industry,” Thomas added. Related: Australia’s top court sides with Block Earner, dismisses ASIC appealIn February, the Anti-Money Laundering regulator took action against 13 remittance service providers and crypto exchanges, with over 50 others still being investigated regarding possible compliance issues.Six providers were refused registration renewal on the grounds that key personnel were either convicted, prosecuted, or charged with a serious offense.Australia has yet to pass crypto regulations.

2025-04-29 23:56:16,Trump Media considers crypto token and wallet for streaming arm,Cointelegraph,"Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media conglomerate backed by US President Donald Trump, is considering integrating a crypto token and wallet into its video streaming site, Truth+.""We're exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,"" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes wrote in an April 29 letter to shareholders.He added that the crypto token and wallet would be part of a rewards program that Trump Media is exploring across its services, which include the social media platform Truth Social and the financial services platform Truth.Fi.Trump Media first signaled plans for a potential crypto payments venture last November when it filed a trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for computer software designed to function as a digital wallet, enable digital asset trading and process crypto payments on Truth.Fi.Source: CointelegraphTruth+ launched in October, offering movies and shows mainly targeting a politically conservative audience.Trump Media signed a binding agreement with the crypto exchange Crypto.com and asset manager Yorkville America Digital to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that will include crypto and stocks “with a Made in America focus” to launch on Truth.Fi.The company said in January that it plans to invest up to $250 million of its cash reserves into a range of financial products, including Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto tokens or crypto-related securities, which would be custodied by asset manager Charles Schwab.More potential for conflict of interestThe launch of a Trump Media utility token would only heighten concerns about the president’s crypto-related ventures potentially conflicting with his duties.

2025-04-29 23:30:00,"Labor pain, crypto gain — How weak JOLTS data sets path for Bitcoin price to rally",Cointelegraph,"Key points:Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the 7.5 million that economists had forecast. Meanwhile, US consumer confidence fell for the fifth straight month in April, reaching its lowest point since January 2021. US Consumer Confidence (left) vs. Total non-farm US job openings (right). Source: TradingView/CointelegraphWorsening conditions raise the chances that central banks will introduce economic stimulus measures, making the overall impact on cryptocurrency markets uncertain. Typically, the additional liquidity encourages investment in risk-on assets like Bitcoin, as more capital flows into the economy.Future expectations matter more than today’s weak economic dataThe last time the US experienced a drop in job openings and weakening consumer confidence was between January and June 2024. In the three months that followed, Bitcoin’s price moved between $53,000 and $66,000. Then, a 60% rally began in mid-October, pushing BTC above $100,000. The final result was positive, but it took more than 105 days for this effect to show in the cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin/USD, log scale. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAlthough these conditions may seem worrying at first, weaker labor and consumer sentiment are usually backward-looking. Financial markets and companies base their decisions on expectations for future economic growth, rather than just past data. Also, improved sentiment among crypto investors tends to come after there is some confirmation of better macroeconomic conditions. This explains why the 105-day lag is not unusual.Before 2024, a similar situation occurred between January and June 2023, with declines in both job market data and consumer confidence. The next four months were difficult, as Bitcoin’s price fell 18% to $25,000. It took 115 days for the price to recover to $30,500 by late October. However, the following two months were very positive, with BTC gaining 45% to reach $43,900.Bitcoin/USD in 2020, log scale. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThe last time in the past eight years when both the labor market and consumer confidence suffered significantly was between February 2020 and May 2020, right after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdowns. This period saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $4,000 on March 13, 2020. As a result, a longer period of consolidation was expected before investors regained confidence in the crypto markets.Related: Bitcoin acts like ‘store of value that it is’ amid Trump policy chaos: NYDIGCould Bitcoin hit $140,000 by October?Looking back at the macroeconomic data, there was no major impact on Bitcoin between May 2020 and September 2020, as its price increased from $8,900 to $10,600, a 20% gain. However, the next 60 days brought an impressive 85% rally to $19,700. For the third time, weaker labor and consumer sentiment data seemed to come before a rally in Bitcoin prices.While the time between the lowest point of economic conditions and Bitcoin’s rally ranged from 105 to 130 days, the result was clear in all three cases. Therefore, if US job openings and consumer confidence improve from April 2025, it is likely that Bitcoin’s price will start to rise by mid-July. If history repeats itself, this could mean a minimum target of $140,000 by October 2025, but further positive macroeconomic data is needed to confirm this outlook.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-04-29 22:22:45,Bitcoin price still in bargain zone as US jobs report sparks rate cut hopes,Cointelegraph,"Key Takeaways:Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, with none above 3, indicating that Bitcoin is less expensive compared to its network strength. Bitcoin Yardstick chart.

Illiquid supply rose from 61.50% to 63.49%, while liquid supply fell by 4%, indicating holders are increasingly committed to long-term positions.

Source: Fidelity Digital Asset Signals ReportIn line with this view, Cointelegraph reported that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF recorded a significant inflow of $970.9 million on April 28, 2025, marking its second-largest daily inflow since its January 2024 launch.Since April 22, IBIT has amassed over $4.5 billion in net inflows, defying broader market trends where competitors like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK’s ARKB faced outflows. With over $54 billion in assets under management, IBIT holds a 51% share of the US spot Bitcoin ETF market.Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF buys $970M in BTC as inflows surge, boost marketBitcoin gets a boost from US JOLTS data The March 2025 US Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) report showed a plunge to 7.19 million from February’s 7.57 million, below the 7.48 million forecast. A lower-than-expected JOLTS number signals a cooling labor market, raising expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which weakens the dollar and lifts risk assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, a higher-than-expected figure suggests economic strength, potentially delaying cuts and pressuring crypto prices. With federal layoffs at a 2020 peak, market expectations are leaning slightly dovish.Economist and Bitcoin commentator Alex Kruger identified the JOLTS data as a short-term win for Bitcoin, as a “risk/gold hybrid” poised to gain from tariff de-escalation after Trump’s 90-day pause (ending July 8). In an X post, the analyst predicted that markets may focus on earnings guidance from firms like Caterpillar and tech stocks, while keeping an eye on next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet, where Powell might signal earlier rate cuts. Kruger warned of a Q3 economic slowdown where the markets may be volatile, but he also said that Bitcoin’s unique risk-reward would outperform altcoins, which the analyst pointed out as overbought.Related: Bitcoin 'hot supply' nears $40B as new investors flood in at $95KThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Since then, several companies have followed its lead, including Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and GameStop.The Bank of Italy also addressed stablecoins in its report, noting potential risks if dollar-pegged tokens were to become systemic. It suggested that increased reliance on US government bonds to back these assets could introduce broader financial vulnerabilities. According to the report, disruptions in either the stablecoins or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”The report comes just a few days after Giancarlo Giorgetti, the country’s minister of economy and finance, warned that the appeal of US dollar stablecoins should not be underestimated.

2025-04-29 19:15:00,Bitcoin price always rallies at least 50% after these two patterns emerge,Cointelegraph,"Key takeaways:Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.Bitcoin/USD, log scale. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphSignificant Bitcoin rallies occur when US Federal Reserve policy expectations ease, crypto market leverage is low, and strong retail data supports bullish momentum. The last occurrence of these three events saw Bitcoin’s price climb from $40,000 to $73,500 in seven weeks in early 2024.Comparable gains were recorded in early 2023, when the same three drivers aligned, propelling Bitcoin from $16,700 to $25,100 over seven weeks. A third example dates back to July 2021, culminating in a 76% price increase.Bitcoin gained 84% from Jan. 25, 2024, to March 13, 2024After stagnating near $43,000 in December 2023, Bitcoin’s price tested the $48,000 level in early January 2024. The failed breakout was followed by a sharp drop to $37,800 by late January, just as a seven-week bullish trend began. A crucial factor at this stage was the exceptionally low perpetual futures funding rate, sitting at 4% per year.Binance BTC perpetual futures funding rate, annualized. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphOther factors impacting the price reversal was US retail sales data for December 2023, released on Jan. 17, 2024, exceeded expectations, rising 0.6% month-over-month compared to the 0.4% forecast and US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s Jan. 31, 2024 press conference that, signaled a tighter monetary stance, with no immediate interest rate cuts in sight.Bitcoin gained 50% from Jan. 3, 2023, to Feb. 20, 2023Prior to this rally, Bitcoin had consolidated below $18,000 for two months, resulting in minimal demand for leveraged long positions, as reflected by a near-zero perpetual futures funding rate.Binance BTC perpetual futures funding rate, annualized. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThe landscape shifted on Jan. 3, 2023, when the funding rate on Binance surged to 50% within four days. This coincided with stronger-than-expected retail sales data for January 2023, which rose 3% month-over-month, outpacing the 1.9% consensus. Notably, Fed Chair Powell also suggested a tighter monetary policy to combat inflation during his speech at Sveriges Riksbank on Jan. 10, 2023.Bitcoin 76% rally: July 20, 2021 – Sept. 7, 2021From July 20, 2021, to Sept. 7, 2021, Bitcoin gained 76%. Bitcoin’s price had dropped from $40,000 to below $30,000 over the preceding month, dampening market sentiment. Suddenly, the annualized Bitcoin funding rate jumped from 0% to 37% in two weeks, while US retail sales data for June 2021 surprised economists by increasing 0.6%, even though consensus had predicted a 0.4% decline.During this period, Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Aug. 27, 2021, indicated a potential reduction in central bank asset purchases, which was a move aimed at curbing inflation.Related: Ray Dalio says global monetary order ‘on the brink’ of breakdownBitcoin’s next potential upswingThe common thread linking these significant rallies is a reduction in expectations for expansionary Federal Reserve policy and initially low leverage demand from Bitcoin bulls. When these factors coincide with robust retail data, they create ideal conditions for a Bitcoin bull run, as traders tend to remain cautious ahead of possible economic downturns.Looking ahead, Fed Chair Powell is set to speak on June 18 following the central bank’s interest rate decision. Additional key dates include the Beige Book release on July 16 and the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium starting Aug. 21.

2025-04-29 12:20:18,A16z leads $25M funding for Miden blockchain project,Cointelegraph,"A16z Crypto led a $25 million investment round into Miden, an independent blockchain project spun out of Polygon Labs.Miden closed its $25 million seed rounds led by a16z Crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC, with participation from Finality Capital Partners, Symbolic Capital, P2 Ventures, Delta Fund, MH Ventures, as well as from angel investors, including MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen and EigenLayer’s Sreeram Kannan.Miden is a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof-powered blockchain focused on high scalability through its hybrid consensus mode, which moves transaction execution from the mainnet on “edge devices,” referring to users’ devices.Designed for institutions that value confidentiality, Miden enables applications to execute both public and private transactions with full privacy, according to an April 29 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.Execution on edge devices can help with the “bottlenecks that limit traditional chains,” said Bobbin Threadbare, the co-founder at Miden and former engineer at Meta, adding:“It allows blockchains to scale without relying on supernodes or sacrificing decentralization, while making privacy a built-in feature instead of an afterthought.”The $25 million will be used to fund Miden’s development, and its mainnet launch is slated for the fourth quarter of 2025.Related: Coinbase to launch yield-bearing Bitcoin fund for institutionsMiden is “the future of blockchains,” says Polygon Labs’ Nailwal“Miden is what the future of blockchains looks like. With edge execution at its core, it’s not just an upgrade — it’s the blueprint for the final form of blockchain architecture,” according to Sandeep Nailwal, the founder of Polygon Labs.“With ambitions to rival Solana, Sui, and Aptos — and to be the epicenter of crosschain liquidity for Agglayer as a native chain and help grow the Agglayer ecosystem— building independently naturally positions Miden to attract the capital and focus needed to compete at the highest level,” Nailwal added.Miden plans to airdrop around 10% of its native tokens to Polygon (POL) tokenholders and stakers to reward its native ecosystem.Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF buys $970M in BTC as inflows surge, boost marketNo existing blockchain is ready for mass adoption: Miden co-founder“The reality is that no existing blockchain is ready for mass adoption,” either lacking privacy, scalability, or Web3-native principles such as censorship resistance, according to Miden’s Threadbare.However, Miden’s infrastructure may be a “catalyst for large institutional adoption,” he claimed, adding:“The reality is that up until this point, blockchains have not been in the position to offer privacy without compromising on performance or programmability, which is a major issue.”Large tech firms joining the space require privacy solutions with regulatory compliance, leaving a significant gap for solutions like Miden, added the co-founder.Inco: the fourth layer of the blockchain stackOther industry watchers have also criticized the industry’s lack of confidentiality for limiting institutional adoption.Confidential computing technologies such as fully homomorphic encryption could unlock the next $1 trillion worth of capital for the crypto space with continued technological development, Remi Gai, the founder of Inco, told Cointelegraph.Magazine: Altcoin season to hit in Q2?

2025-04-29 11:58:04,Trump’s first 100 days ‘worst in history’ despite crypto promises,Cointelegraph,"The first 100 days of the administration of US President Donald Trump have deeply impacted the crypto industry, starting with his own memecoin and culminating in a Bitcoin reserve and a spate of blockchain policymaking. Trump’s trade war with the entire world has had the largest short-term impact on crypto markets, as crypto prices have wavered amid macroeconomic worry and uncertainty. Higher prices on electronics mean Bitcoin (BTC) miners are finding it harder to break even, and de-dollarization concerns abound. Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The crypto industry’s long-awaited regulatory framework is also imminent. Trump’s first 100 days have seen remarkable changes for the crypto industry, and it appears that things are only getting started. Here’s a look at what’s happened so far.Jan. 20 — Trump’s first 100 days kick off with a memecoinOn Jan. 20, while Trump was sworn into office in the rotunda of the Capitol Building, his family’s crypto investment firm, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), launched its second token sale of WLFI tokens.Massive demand saw prices initially spike, though the true value of the tokens, if any, is yet to be determined, as WLFI is currently not transferable and cannot be traded on any exchanges. The memecoin served as a kickoff for Trump’s crypto agenda, which has seen unprecedented support for the industry in Washington, DC, along with a slew of moral and ethical concerns among observers and lawmakers. Related: Trump’s WLFI crypto investments aren’t paying offJan. 20 — Pro-crypto leaders head up federal agencies on “day one”The president of the US sets the tone for several federal regulators, including those overseeing crypto. Trump immediately set out to appoint a number of pro-crypto lawyers and businessmen to head up the SEC, the CFTC and other critical federal agencies.Trump nominated businessman Paul Atkins to lead the SEC on “day one” of his presidency. Atkins would replace Gary Gensler, who was perceived by many in the crypto industry as an enemy to adoption and the industry’s progress. Also on day one, Trump appointed businessman and crypto investor David Sacks as chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology — or the crypto and AI “czar.”Atkins wouldn’t be confirmed by the Senate until April 9 and sworn in on April 21. But in the meantime, Trump also tapped former CFTC Commissioner and crypto proponent Brian Quintenz to head up that agency. Jan. 21 — $500-billion Stargate AI initiative In a press conference, Trump announced a $500-billion private-led AI infrastructure investment called “Stargate.” The president claimed the project — led by ChatGPT creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle — would create some 10,000 American jobs.Trump said the US needed to lead the world in AI innovation and keep development onshore. “China is a competitor, others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we’re making it available,” he said.OpenAI claimed that the project would “not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.”Jan. 21 — Pardon for Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht Trump announced on Truth Social that he had called the family of Silk Road 2.0 founder Ross Ulbricht after commuting his sentence.After his arrest in 2013, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 without the possibility of parole for his role in facilitating the trafficking of narcotics and other illicit substances. Ulbricht’s case became a rallying point for libertarian movements and prison reform advocates alike. Libertarian-minded crypto advocates supported Ulbricht, as his platform was one of the first places people could actually spend Bitcoin. Crypto advocates supported Ulbricht, with many believing he did nothing wrong. Source: The Bitcoin HistorianFreeing Ulbricht was one of the many campaign promises Trump made to the crypto community.Jan. 23 — Ban on digital dollar, establishing a crypto working groupWith an executive order, Trump established an internal working group to focus on making the US “the world capital in crypto.” The order also prohibited “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDCs are a contentious issue in the crypto community, with many privacy activists claiming that they are another form of state surveillance and government control. Enthusiasm over their creation from central bankers has further set the more libertarian-minded crypto community against their creation.Trump signing the executive order. Source: ABC NewsThe working group would kickstart the process for creating the forthcoming US Bitcoin and crypto reserves. Feb. 1 — Trade war begins with tariffs on Mexico, China and CanadaOne of the promises of the Trump campaign was to rectify the “bad deals” that the US had with many of its oldest allies and most important trading partners. Just over a week after he was sworn into office, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, citing border security concerns and the supposed proliferation of cross-border trade of fentanyl from those countries. The same day, Canada announced retaliatory measures. On Feb. 3, Mexico promised to step up security of its northern border, responding to American requests for increased patrols. This led Trump to reverse initial tariff plans on both countries. The unexpected hostile tariffs from a close partner and ally sent stock and crypto prices tumbling. They marked the beginning of the macroeconomic uncertainty that has come to characterize the early days of the Trump administration. Feb. 12 — Vinnik-Foegel prisoner swap with RussiaAlexander Vinnik, the convicted money launderer who funneled Bitcoin stolen in the infamous Mt. Gox hack through his crypto exchange BTC-e, returned to his home country of Russia.Vinnik pled guilty to money laundering conspiracy charges in 2024. BTC-e processed more than $9 billion in transactions and had over 1 million users worldwide, many of whom were in the US.Vinnik was exchanged for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was teaching at the Anglo-American School of Moscow and had been in a Russian jail since 2021 after being arrested for illegal possession of cannabis. Feb. 18 — Bankman-Fried makes veiled plea for releaseIn an interview with The New York Sun, the former CEO of now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, addressed his controversial political contributions, saying the Republican Party was always “far more reasonable.”Bankman-Fried, or SBF, made widely publicized contributions to the Democratic Party as he purportedly tried to influence democratic policymakers’ approach to the digital asset industry. It later became known that SBF was playing both sides of the aisle, donating significant funds to Republicans, though the exact amount remains unknown. In the interview, SBF likened his position to that of Trump, claiming that he’d been unfairly treated by the criminal justice system. SBF called into question the conduct of the federal judge overseeing his trial, Judge Lewis Kaplan. “I know President Trump had a lot of frustrations with Judge Kaplan. I certainly did as well.”Observers saw the interview as an attempt to elicit a pardon from Trump. Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin advocate facing criminal tax evasion charges, has made an outright appeal.March 7 — Trump establishes Bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpileOn March 7, the 46th day of Trump’s presidency, he signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Trump made big promises about crypto adoption on the campaign trail, including the possibility of a long-sought-after Bitcoin reserve. The US reserve, however, would fall short of expectations among Bitcoin maximalists. Rather than create a concrete plan for the US government to purchase and hold Bitcoin, it merely created a single reserve to pool all Bitcoin the government had seized during criminal proceedings.While the order does state that the government may purchase additional Bitcoin, it must do so in a budget-neutral fashion. In tandem with the Bitcoin reserve, Trump also established a US Digital Asset Stockpile containing other cryptocurrencies such as Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA).March 7 — White House Crypto SummitLeaders of the crypto industry descended on Washington for a meeting at the White House to discuss a wide range of topics related to crypto regulation and the development of the industry in the US.Attendees included Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and “crypto czar” David Sacks. While some attendees, including Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, were optimistic about the event’s focus on strengthening the US crypto industry, some crypto luminaries who were not on the list were less impressed.Cardano and IOHK co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who did not attend the event, noted in a video stream that real change — i.e., legislation — must be made in Congress. “Everybody focuses on the White House because it’s simple and easy to do so. [...] And as much as we, as an industry, want this to be a short process, it’s going to be a long and methodical process,” Hoskinson said.Others put it more simply:Source: George MandrikMarch 25 — WLFI goes stablecoinWLFI expanded its offerings in March with the soft launch of its stablecoin USD1. The coin, “100% backed by short-term US government treasuries, US dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents,” launched on the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks.News of the token’s launch came just days after WLFI secured more than $500 million by selling its own WLFI tokens.US lawmakers subsequently called for an ethics probe into WLFI and cited the president’s ability to influence stablecoin policy as a major conflict of interest with the project. Related: Atkins becomes next SEC chair: What’s next for the crypto industryApril 2 — Liberation DayDoubling down on his belligerent trade policy, Trump levies tariffs on all US trade partners on what he dubs “Liberation Day.” At a special event at the White House, Trump signed an executive order levying reciprocal tariffs on every country with a tariff on US goods, starting at a 10% minimum.Markets saw a spate of red across the board following the order, and many economic observers raised concerns over a looming recession. Crypto miners based in the US were further squeezed as their operation costs, namely for buying new mining rigs, increased significantly. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci told Cointelegraph, “I would say that he’s had the worst 95 days in modern presidential history. The markets recovered a little, but we’ve got $9 trillion taken from the stock market. You had a growing economy that’s now heading into a medium-sized recession, possibly a steep recession.”He said that Trump declared a trade war “without any real weaponry” and subsequently lied about progress when the president claimed China was attempting to negotiate.“The lies are ok — everyone accepts that he’s a congenital liar [...] but when you’re declaring war on people and then you’re lying, it’s really bad.”April 25 — $300,000-per-plate memecoin dinner raises call for impeachmentTop Trump memecoin holders were reportedly offered an opportunity to have dinner with the president, sparking renewed concerns over his crypto project and prompting one US lawmaker to support impeachment. At a town hall meeting in his home state of Georgia, Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff said he “strongly” supports impeachment. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” he said.TRUMP holders can register to have dinner with the President. Source: gettrumpmemes.comRumors on social media stated that $300,000 would grant tokenholders an audience with the president, a claim the Trump administration later denied.Trump’s first 100 days could jeopardize changeThe first 100 days of Trump’s presidency have brought unprecedented change to the crypto industry. Simultaneously, they have opened it up to increased criticism and controversy as the president’s personal ties with blockchain projects raise ethical questions. These controversies may well jeopardize the industry’s efforts to effect change in Congress, according to Scaramucci, who said, “Trump has so inflamed everything that he’s made it even hard for [stablecoin legislation] to happen.”The STABLE Act, which aims to provide guardrails for stablecoin issuance in the US, was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 26 and passed a committee vote on April 3, with prominent Democrats dissenting. The bill will soon head to the floor for a general vote before going to the Senate. The Senate’s GENIUS Act has recently made headway, passing a vote in the Banking Committee, largely along party lines.Magazine: Bitcoin $100K hopes on ice, SBF’s mysterious prison move: Hodler’s Digest, April 20 – 26",https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-first-100-days-worst-in-history-despite-crypto-promises?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The firm’s global capacity now reportedly exceeds 500 MW.Phoenix’s co-founder and CEO, Munaf Ali, said the firm’s strategy relies on “securing prime locations with abundant, low-cost energy.”“Initiatives like our latest expansion in Ethiopia are pivotal steps, not only creating significant value today but also solidifying our position,” he said.Related: Arkansas city rejects crypto mining proposal after community pushbackBuilding on previous agreementsThe news follows Phoenix Group signing an agreement that secures the right to 80 MW of power in Ethiopia in January. An announcement published at the time noted that the new Bitcoin mining site was scheduled to go live in the second quarter of 2025.The 52 MW site will be developed in two phases, with the first one using just 20 MW to power 5,300 air-cooled mining units with an expected hashrate of 1.2 exahashes per second. In the second phase — expected to reach completion by the end of Q2 2025 — the site will use the full 52 MW, water cooling, and produce an estimated 2.4 exahashes per second of hashrate.An exahash is a unit of computational power used mainly to measure the speed of cryptocurrency mining networks, especially Bitcoin. Exahashes quantify how many trillions of calculations a mining network can perform per second.Reza Nedjatian, the CEO of the firm’s mining, artificial intelligence and data center subsidiary, highlighted that the plant will be powered by renewable energy:“With 132 MW now running on clean hydropower, we’re proud to set a new benchmark for sustainable mining in Africa and deliver large-scale operations in energy-rich regions.”Related: LAPD recovers $2.7M worth of Bitcoin miners stolen in airport heistA fast-burn companyPhoenix Group became a publicly-traded company following its late 2023 listing on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.

Data from the platform showed users had poured more than $1 million into bets on the event.Polymarket odds of what Trump will say in his 100-day speech. Source: Polymarket Trump’s rhetoric could drive short-term price surges, just like in the past. For example, Bitcoin’s recent recovery from $74,400 to $94,000 was partly fueled by Trump’s comments that tariffs on goods from China ""will come down substantially.” While the speech may spark optimism and price spikes, broader market dynamics, including tariffs and global trade tensions, could temper gains, as seen with recent crypto market fluctuations.Over $4.7 billion in BTC leave exchangesApart from possible positive comments from Trump, Bitcoin’s declining supply on exchanges supports the bullish case for a rally toward $100,000. Investors have withdrawn over 50,500 BTC (worth $4.7 billion) from exchanges since easing macroeconomic tensions sparked a marketwide rally.Bitcoin reserve on exchanges.

Historically, the metric’s climb into the 85–90% range has signaled a transition from healthy optimism to speculative euphoria among traders.Between October and December 2024, for instance, Bitcoin’s price climbed from around $80,000 to over $100,000, a rally coinciding with Bitcoin’s profitable supply rising from under 80% to as high as 99%.Bitcoin percent supply in profit. Source: CryptoQuantIn his April 28 post, CryptoQuant-based analyst DarkFrost reminded that Bitcoin’s euphoric phases may not last for longer timeframes, leading to sharp corrections as holders begin realizing gains. BTC’s price established a record high of nearly $110,000 in January, with its profitable supply hitting 99%. But the cryptocurrency dropped by over 30% afterward. Similar profit-taking behaviors have led to price corrections in the past, as shown above.“Currently, the supply in profit has climbed back above 85%, which is fairly positive,” DarkFrost writes, noting that its recovery from the recent bottom of 75% is still better when compared to 45-50% lows witnessed during bear market corrections.Besides, the BTC supply in profit still remains below 90%. Crossing above 90% has historically preceded profit-taking behavior among traders, suggesting that there’s more room to grow for BTC prices in the coming days.DarkFrost argues:“Of course, there are certain levels that are more ""comfortable"" than others, but generally, an increase in the supply in profit tends to fuel bullish phases.” Additional onchain data also supports the bullish outlook. Bitcoin’s First Buyers and Momentum Buyers are actively accumulating, while Profit Takers remain relatively quiet, according to Glassnode metric tracking BTC’s cumulative supply per cohort.BTC relative strength index of cumulative supply per cohort.

His trial is still set for July, and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia.The DeFi Education Fund said that in Storm’s case, the Department of Justice is attempting to hold software developers criminally liable for how others use their code, which is “not only absurd in principle, but it sets a precedent that potentially chills all crypto development in the United States.”The group also called for the recognition that the prosecution contradicts the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance from Trump’s first term, which established that developers of self-custodial, peer-to-peer protocols are not money transmitters. Source: DeFi Education Fund“This kind of legal environment does not just chill innovation — it freezes it,” they argued. The letter added that it also “empowers politically-motivated enforcement and puts every open-source developer at risk, regardless of industry.”In January, a federal court in Texas ruled that the Treasury overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash. Stakes could not be higherThe group thanked Trump for his support of the industry and his stated goal to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” They added, however, that his goal can’t be realized if developers are prosecuted for building tools that enable the technology.“We ask President Trump to protect American software developers, restore legal clarity, and end this unlawful DOJ overreach. The job’s not finished, and the stakes could not be higher.”Related: Tornado Cash dev wants charges dropped after court said OFAC ‘overstepped’Variant Fund chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky said the Justice Department’s case against Storm is “an outdated remnant of the Biden administration's war on crypto.” “There is no justification in law or policy for prosecuting software developers for launching non-custodial smart contract protocols,” he added. At the time of writing, the petition had attracted 232 signatures from industry executives and developers, including Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko, among others.Magazine: Bitcoin $100K hopes on ice, SBF’s mysterious prison move: Hodler’s Digest",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-group-trump-end-prosecution-crypto-devs-roman-storm?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum.The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion, an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space.With the launch of its card, MetaMask is entering a competitive segment of the cryptocurrency market. Major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, and Crypto.com already offer crypto debit cards, some of which feature ""crypto-back"" rewards that allow users to earn digital assets on their purchases.MetaMask has struggled lately as interest in and participation in the Ethereum ecosystem have dried up. According to Dune Analytics, the wallet collected just $289,312 in fees for the week of April 14, much less than the $1.3 million in fees collected for the same period a year ago.

2025-04-28 18:00:00,Global central bank gold rush could spark Bitcoin price run to new all-time highs,Cointelegraph,"Key takeaways: US Treasury funds saw $19 billion inflows, the highest since March 2023, as the 30-year yield fell 30 basis points.Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%.Bitcoin soared in 2020 from $9,000 to $60,000 amid similar trends, hinting at a similar outcome in 2025. The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion—the highest since March 2023.US Treasurys inflow chart. Source: X.comThe 30-year US Treasury yield fell by 30 basis points from its April peak, indicating a rise in bond prices as investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the safety of these bonds. This surge in demand for Treasurys as a safe-haven asset boosts market liquidity and stability while lowering US borrowing costs.However, foreign central banks have pivoted, cutting Treasury holdings to 23% of US government debt, a 22-year low. This suggests that while private investors were possibly driving inflows, foreign central banks are stepping back, possibly due to the ongoing tariff dispute with the US. Foreign central banks’ gold and treasury holdings. Source: X.comAt the same time, gold’s share of global reserves has surged to 18%, a 26-year high, up 8% since 2015, with China doubling its gold reserves to 7.1% since 2023. This global de-dollarization trend mirrors a pattern that favors Bitcoin. During the 2020 pandemic, when US Treasury inflows spiked amid COVID-19 uncertainty, Bitcoin soared from $9,000 to nearly $60,000 by early 2021, with gold’s share of global reserves rising by 14.5% in 18 months. The current environment, marked by a stabilizing bond market and a central bank’s gold rush, implies a similar trigger for Bitcoin’s next bullish move. In 2023, when US Treasury yields rose amid recession fears, Bitcoin gained 47% in a month while the Nasdaq dropped 8.7%. With yields easing and central banks signaling a lack of faith in the US dollar, Bitcoin’s appeal as a global store of value improves.However, Bitcoin’s bullish narrative could falter if global markets enter a recession in 2025. This is due to investors’ decision to prioritize liquidity and traditional safe-haven assets like cash or US Treasurys during economic downturns, as noted last week, over speculative assets like Bitcoin.Related: Bitcoin upside could stop at $100K despite $3B in ETF inflowsGoogle searches for “Bitcoin” at long-term lows, says Bitwise CEOAnonymous global markets researcher Capital Flows noted that macroeconomic liquidity and positioning factors drive Bitcoin’s bullish price trajectory.

2025-04-28 17:49:09,Loopscale hacker in talks to return stolen crypto,Cointelegraph,"The hacker behind the $5.8 million recent Loopscale exploit is in talks to return the stolen funds in exchange for a bounty, the Solana-based protocol said. The exploiter pilfered approximately 5.7 million USDC (USDC) and 1,200 Solana (SOL) tokens from two of Loopscale’s yield vaults on April 26, prompting the decentralized finance protocol to temporarily pause its lending markets. The following day, the hacker sent a message on the Etherscan blockchain scanner “indicat[ing] a willingness to return the exploited funds in exchange for a bounty,” Loopscale said in an April 27 X post. “We are agreeable to collaborating with you to reach a white hat agreement. However, we would like to negotiate the bounty percentage; our expectation is 20%,” the hacker said. “To demonstrate our commitment to a cooperative approach, we will immediately return the 5,000 wSOL funds following the transmission of this message,” they added.Negotiations are ongoing for the remaining funds, according to the public messaging exchange on Etherscan. Messages exchanged with the Loopscale hacker.

This price movement closely tracked the decline in US Treasury yields, suggesting that traders were seeking the relative safety of more secure assets.While Bitcoin traders are moderately satisfied with the 6% gains achieved over the past week, there is ongoing uncertainty as to why BTC has been unable to maintain levels above $95,000.US 5-year Treasury yield  (left) vs Bitcoin/USD, 15 min. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphThe abrupt correction in Bitcoin’s price after reaching $95,500 mirrored the intraday performance of US Treasury yields. A decrease in yields indicates that investors are willing to accept lower returns for holding bonds, which signals increased demand for safer investments. This pattern suggests a sudden decline in risk appetite across major financial markets.China’s tariff cuts fueled optimism, but US trade concerns reversed sentimentInvestors’ optimism increased over the weekend as news that China had quietly reduced tariffs to zero on selected US semiconductor and circuit board imports was reported by Newsweek on April 25. Notably, the US Russell 2000 small-cap index maintained positive momentum on April 28, remaining near its highest level in over three weeks. However, this sentiment reversed following an interview with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on CNBC, in which he placed the responsibility for a trade agreement on China.US Russell 2000 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD, 1h. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphAlthough recession risks have increased amid escalating trade tensions, many US companies are currently reporting strong first-quarter results. According to a FactSet report, 73% of these companies have posted earnings that exceeded analysts’ expectations.Bitcoin’s repeated failure to sustain levels above $95,000 appears to be linked to broader macroeconomic concerns. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s inability to decouple from stock market trends indicates that investors are not yet convinced of Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a hedge during potential economic downturns.There are also concerns that much of the recent bullish momentum, which has kept Bitcoin’s price above $90,000, has been driven by $4.28 billion in BTC acquisitions by Strategy since mid-March. Furthermore, 97% of the previously approved common share issuance has already been utilized, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of Michael Saylor’s accumulation strategy.Bitcoin struggles as strong stock earnings contrast with macroeconomic concernsWhile the stock market is benefiting from a robust earnings season, Bitcoin’s price is being weighed down by perceptions of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions.US existing home sales in March recorded their largest monthly decline in over two years, falling 5.9% compared to the previous month. Meanwhile, China has outlined plans to support employment and assist exporters after factories reduced production due to weak consumer demand, according to CNBC.Related: Crypto ETPs hit 3rd-largest inflows on record at $3.4B — CoinSharesGiven the current global economic uncertainty, a sustained rally in BTC above $100,000 will require more than a single week of strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly as this coincides with significant buying activity from Strategy.For investors to have confidence in a new Bitcoin all-time high in 2025, the cryptocurrency must demonstrate a clearer divergence from US stock market trends and provide further evidence that central banks will inject liquidity to prevent a crisis. At present, traders are focused on the trajectory of US interest rates and the possibility of a reversal in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, which could end a period of monetary tightening that has lasted for more than two years.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
