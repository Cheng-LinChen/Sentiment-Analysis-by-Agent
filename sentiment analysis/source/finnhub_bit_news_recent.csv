2025-04-15 15:00:00,Crypto podcasters should always assume their audience knows nothing,Cointelegraph,"Opinion by: Blake Cassidy, CEO of BambooCrypto podcasts have been newcomers’ go-to source of information, helping bring crypto into the mainstream. Podcasters must remember, however, that fresh faces are constantly tuning in as they grow.While you may say, “FOMO, buy the dip, ignore the FUD because WAGMI,” your poor listener — tuning in for the first time just trying to learn crypto — might decide learning Spanish is easier.Podcasters are more vital to crypto’s adoption rate than everKeeping regular listeners engaged is important, but so is making sure newbies, who are only listening because they’re sick of hearing their mates brag about crypto at work, can follow along, too.You can see this balance pulled off well in some of the biggest crypto podcasts out there. Crypto podcasts that cater to the hodler and the novice enjoy dedicated followings and high view counts, whether the market is feeling bullish or bearish. Some worry that making things newbie-friendly will turn off industry professionals, but that’s not the case. Even the experts appreciate simplified content — it helps them stay on top of the week without digging through all the noise themselves.How do you get that balance right? Work in the week’s biggest news, and it’ll appeal to everyone — whether they’re new to crypto or industry veterans. Even if it’s just a segment of your podcast, crypto enthusiasts at any level love having a go-to podcast that sums up the week before they’ve even had their morning coffee.Crypto’s accessibility problemAccessibility has always been one of crypto’s biggest hurdles. The tech, the endless list of coins, even Web3-powered video games — many see it all as too complicated, unnecessary or just another scam. Some of these views represent a misunderstanding at best and outright ignorance at worst.On the flip side, podcasters talk about quantum-resistant blockchains, unlimited transactions per second or Ethereum’s dreaded Surge, Verge, Purge and Splurge malarky. There is a delicate balancePodcasters can play a key role in moving blockchain solutions further into the mainstream by helping to overcome the high knowledge entry requirements we’ve seen previously.There is a balance, however, as nobody wants to listen to an explainer podcast that feels like a weekly dictionary of crypto-bro jargon. The key is for podcasters to imagine they are in a room with a friend who knows nothing about crypto and someone who’s already clued in. Create content that works for both. If jargon is a must, which is often in this niche, a “here’s what we mean when we say this” now and then can go a long way to avoid alienating newcomers.Non-technical terms like “WAGMI” and “NGMI” should be spelled out instead of gatekeeping if we want to see retail swarm exchanges. Make it as easy as possible for the audienceSeveral successful podcasts do a great job of providing timestamps in their podcast episodes, which often run longer than an hour. If an audience member can quickly understand what is included in the podcast and navigate to the sections most interesting to them, this will only strengthen engagement and loyalty.Additionally, similes, analogies, metaphors and outright storytelling can help demystify some harder-to-grasp crypto concepts. There are so many ways that podcasters can help rather than hinder the mainstream adoption of crypto. In any discipline, providing clear and concise information so that audiences can make more informed decisions is a responsibility — why should crypto podcasts be any different?Opinion by: Blake Cassidy, CEO of Bamboo.

2025-04-15 13:13:18,Crypto’s debanking problem persists despite new regulations,Cointelegraph,"The crypto industry’s inability to access banking services still concerns many industry observers despite recent policy victories.In past years, financial services firms and banks concerned about fiduciary risk, reporting liabilities and reputational risk often would refuse to offer service to crypto firms — i.e., “debanking” them. Legislative efforts in the United States and Australia are attempting to remove these barriers for the crypto industry. In the former, legislators repealed guidelines that made it difficult for banks to custody crypto assets, as well as those stating that crypto carried “reputational risk” for banks. In the latter, the Labor Party has introduced a bill to create a legal framework for crypto, giving banks the clarity they need to interact with the crypto industry.Despite these tangible efforts, some crypto industry observers say that the crypto’s debanking problem is far from over. US crypto execs say debanking is still an issue The crypto industry has long decried “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” its nickname for a suite of policies that they claim constrained the crypto industry from growing under the administration of former President Joe Biden. Among these were measures making it more difficult for crypto firms to access banking services. The early days of the second administration of President Donald Trump have seen many of these repealed or changed. One of the first was the repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which required banks offering custody for customers’ cryptocurrencies to list them as liabilities on their balance sheets — this made it very difficult for banks to justify offering such services. The administration also appointed a new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Rodney Hood. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Bitcoin-focused policy organization Satoshi Action, told Cointelegraph that under Hood’s tenure, the OCC has already said banks can offer crypto-related services like custody, stablecoin reserves and blockchain participation.Related: Atkins becomes next SEC chair: What’s next for the crypto industry“This opens the door for broader adoption of digital asset technology and custodial services by traditional financial institutions, signaling a major shift in how banks engage with crypto,” he said.Despite these victories, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, said on March 21 that debanking is likely to remain a problem for crypto firms into 2026. Long said the non-partisan board of governors of the Federal Reserve is “still controlled by Democrats,” alluding to Democrats’ more skeptical stance on crypto. Long claimed that “there are two crypto-friendly banks under examination by the Fed right now, and an army of examiners was sent into these banks, including the examiners from Washington, a literal army just smothering the banks.”Long noted that Trump won’t be able to appoint a new Fed governor until January, meaning that, while other agencies may be more crypto-friendly, there are still roadblocks. Australia’s Labor Party to create crypto frameworkStand With Crypto, the “grassroots” crypto advocacy organization started by Coinbase that has spread to the US, UK, Canada and Australia, said that “in Australia, debanking is quietly shutting out innovators and entrepreneurs — particularly in the crypto and blockchain space.”In a post on X, the organization claimed that debanking results in “reputational damage, loss of revenue, increased operational costs, and inability to launch or sustain services.” It also claimed that it forces some companies to move offshore. In response to these concerns, the ruling center-left Labor Party in Australia has proposed a new set of laws for the cryptocurrency industry. The changes to current financial services law seek to tackle the issue of debanking in the country’s cryptocurrency industry.Australia’s Treasury says its new crypto regulations have four priorities. Source: Australian Department of the TreasuryEdward Carroll, head of global markets and corporate finance at MHC Digital Group — an Australian crypto platform — told Cointelegraph that in Australia, debanking decisions were “not the result of regulatory directives.”“Rather, they appear to stem from a more general sense of risk aversion due to the current lack of a clear regulatory framework.”Related: US gov’t actions give clue about upcoming crypto regulationCarroll was optimistic about the Labor Party’s proactive stance. The major political parties were “showing a shift in sentiment and a shared commitment to establishing formal crypto regulation.” “We are hopeful that this will give banks the confidence to reengage with crypto businesses that meet compliance standards,” he said.Canada unlikely to relieve crypto firmsIn Canada, “debanking remains a serious and ongoing challenge for the Canadian crypto industry,” according to Morva Rohani, executive director of the Canadian Web3 Council.“While some firms have successfully established relationships with banking partners, many continue to face account closures or denials with little explanation or recourse,” she told Cointelegraph. While debanking actions aren’t explicit, financial institutions’ interpretation of Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer regulations “creates a risk-averse environment where banks weigh compliance and reputational concerns against the relatively low revenue potential of crypto clients.”The end result, per Rohani, is a systemic debanking problem for the digital assets industry.But unlike in the US and Australia, the Canadian crypto industry may not find relief anytime soon. Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose more crypto-skeptic Liberal Party is surging in the polls ahead of the April 28 snap elections, is himself a crypto-skeptic.Polls show Carney firmly in the lead. Source: IpsosCarney has stated that the future of money lies more in a “central bank stablecoin,” otherwise referred to as a central bank digital currency.Rohani said that “no comprehensive legislative solution has been implemented” as regards to debanking. “A more structured approach, including mandated disclosure of reasons for account termination and regulatory oversight, is needed,” she said.Critics claim crypto is “hijacking” the debanking issueThere is another side to the debanking debate, which claims that crypto’s debanking “problem” is a non-issue or a vehicle for crypto firms to get what they want in terms of regulation. Molly White, the author of Web3 Is Going Just Great and the “Citation Needed” newsletter, has noted that, in the US at least, crypto firms have claimed to be victims of debanking while lauding Trump’s efforts to end protections for debanking at the same time.In a Feb. 14 post, White stated that the crypto industry had “hijacked” the discussion around debanking, which contains legitimate concerns regarding access to financial services — particularly regarding discrimination due to race, religious identity or industry affiliation. She claims the crypto industry has used debanking as a means to deflect legitimate regulatory inquiries into crypto companies’ compliance efforts. Further of note is the fact that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has applauded the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with Elon Musk at the helm, to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). One of the CFPB’s responsibilities is to investigate claims of debanking. But when DOGE instructed the agency to halt all work, Armstrong said it was “100% the right call,” in addition to making dubious claims about the agency’s constitutionality. In the meantimeWhether the industry’s debanking concerns stem from legitimate discrimination or an attempt at regulatory capture, crypto firms are developing solutions in the interim. Porter said that, as an alternative to banking services, “many crypto companies have leaned on stablecoins as a primary tool for managing finances,” while others have worked with “smaller regional banks or specialized trust companies open to digital assets.”Rohani said that this kind of “patchwork of relationships” can increase operational costs and risks and are “not sustainable long-term solutions for growth or to build a competitive, regulated industry.”Porter concluded that the banking workarounds could actually strengthen the industry’s position, stating that they may “continue evolving into fully integrated relationships with traditional financial institutions, further cementing crypto’s place in mainstream finance.”Magazine: UK’s Orwellian AI murder prediction system, will AI take your job?

2025-04-15 12:55:00,Is Bitcoin the new safe haven during trade wars?,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin joins the safe-haven debate as trade tensions rise              For decades, investors fled to gold and US Treasurys during crises, but in today’s digital, decentralized world, Bitcoin is starting to enter the safe-haven conversation. Despite its volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) has shown signs of resilience during global turbulence, including trade wars, prompting a fresh look at its role in preserving value.Let’s rewind a bit to understand where this question comes from. For decades, whenever uncertainty rattled the global economy, be it war, inflation, or sudden political shifts, investors did what they always do — run to the safest hills. Historically, those hills were made of gold or filled with US Treasury bonds. But things are changing. In a world that’s more digital, decentralized, and volatile than ever, people are asking whether Bitcoin might now be part of the conversation as a modern safe-haven asset, especially during disruptive events like trade wars.To get into this, you need to explore what makes an asset a safe haven in the first place, how Bitcoin has behaved during recent trade-related turbulence and whether it has earned its spot alongside more traditional defensive plays.First, the concept of a “safe haven” isn’t about making a profit. It’s about preserving value. In times of crisis, investors want assets that hold up under pressure. Gold has done this for decades. The US dollar, despite being fiat, is often seen as a safe haven due to its global reserve status and the strength of US financial institutions. Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. All these assets are supposed to be relatively low in volatility and high in liquidity.Now, here’s the twist: Bitcoin is not low in volatility. It’s notoriously wild. But despite that, you might have seen moments where it behaves like a safe haven. Not always, but sometimes, and that’s interesting.Isn’t it?                  The 2018-19 trade war vs Bitcoin’s role in times of turmoil              During the 2018–19 US-China trade war, Bitcoin surged as traditional markets faltered, hinting at its potential as a hedge in turbulent times. While its “digital gold” narrative gained traction, Bitcoin’s behavior often mirrors that of speculative tech stocks, keeping its safe-haven status an open question.Take the 2018–19 US-China trade war, for example. As tariff threats escalated and tensions between the two economic giants intensified, global markets became increasingly jittery. Tech stocks took a hit. Commodities wavered. Amid all this, something strange happened. Bitcoin quietly surged. From April to July 2019, the price of Bitcoin climbed from about $5,000 to over $12,000. It wasn’t alone. Gold also rallied during that time. However, this was one of the earliest signs that Bitcoin might not be just a risk-on asset but could also serve as a hedge in turbulent times. That period sparked a new narrative: Bitcoin as “digital gold.”The fixed supply of 21 million coins gave it scarcity. Its decentralized nature meant it wasn’t bound to any single government’s policies. And because it lived on a global, censorship-resistant network, it was insulated from the kind of capital controls that often follow during periods of financial stress. These qualities started to resonate with investors looking for alternatives to traditional safe havens.To be fair, Bitcoin hasn’t always stuck to the script. While there are moments where it moves inversely to risk assets, more often than not, it behaves like a speculative tech stock, especially over short time frames. Historically, Bitcoin has had a strong correlation with the Nasdaq. So, while the “digital gold” narrative is growing, it still sits side-by-side with the idea of Bitcoin being a high-beta bet for risk-seeking investors.Did you know? A 2025 study titled Institutional Adoption and Correlation Dynamics: Bitcoin’s Evolving Role in Financial Markets analyzed daily data from 2018 to 2025. The study found that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 intensified following key institutional milestones, with peaks reaching 0.87 in 2024. This suggests that Bitcoin has transitioned from an alternative asset toward a more integrated financial instrument.                  Inside the Trump tariff wars of 2025: Markets rattle, Bitcoin rises              In early 2025, Trump’s sweeping tariffs triggered panic across financial markets, with the Nasdaq and S&P suffering historic drops. Within two days, US stock indexes lost trillions, reigniting the debate over Bitcoin's role as a modern safe haven.Fast forward to April 2025, and the question of whether Bitcoin can serve as a safe haven got tested again. This time, it was in a much more pronounced way. In February 2025, Trump, now in his second term as president, announced a fresh wave of aggressive tariffs aimed at revitalizing American manufacturing. This was the kind of headline that immediately spooks financial markets, especially when major trading partners began whispering about retaliation. By April 2, Trump had declared what he called “Liberation Day,” a sweeping set of tariffs covering nearly all imported goods. It was framed as economic patriotism, but to markets, it spelled chaos.Chaos came quickly. On April 3, the Nasdaq Composite plunged by nearly 6%, losing over 1,000 points in one session. This was a record-setting drop in terms of raw numbers. The S&P 500 didn’t fare much better, falling close to 5%. Investors began to panic about supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and a possible global slowdown. Then came April 4, and the panic only deepened. The Nasdaq slid into official bear market territory, and the Dow lost over 2,200 points in a single day. Within 48 hours, America’s major stock indexes had lost trillions in value.Did you know? Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, noted that Bitcoin and the Nasdaq 100 have been driven by speculative fervor fueled by lenient Fed policies. He highlighted that Bitcoin tends to trade in tandem with highly leveraged tech-focused ETFs, indicating a strong correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks.                  Bitcoin didn’t soar amid market crash, but It didn’t sink either              During the April 2025 market crash, Bitcoin held steady while stocks plunged, surprising many with its resilience. It didn’t surge, but its stability amid chaos hinted at its growing role as a value-preserving asset in turbulent times.So, what did Bitcoin do? Surprisingly, nothing catastrophic, and that was the story. While nearly everything else was tanking during the tariff-fueled sell-off, Bitcoin didn’t crash. That alone turned heads.In a market where even the most established benchmarks were falling apart, Bitcoin’s relative stability stood out to portfolio managers and institutional watchers.Long criticized as too volatile for serious portfolios, Bitcoin quietly weathered the storm better than many traditional assets. This wasn’t a moonshot moment. It was a resilience moment. Value preservation over value multiplication. And that’s what investors look for in a safe haven. Its ability to hold ground while the Nasdaq and S&P plunged gave more weight to the idea that Bitcoin might be evolving into something sturdier.To be clear, Bitcoin hasn’t fully decoupled from risk assets. It still responds to liquidity flows, monetary policy and investor sentiment. But at times like April 2025, it showed something different. It didn’t break. It held! And for a growing number of investors, that’s starting to matter.                  Bitcoin isn’t the new gold, but it’s not the old BTC either              Bitcoin’s growing resilience stems from a maturing market, rising institutional adoption and its appeal as a non-sovereign, portable hedge in times of financial or geopolitical stress. While not yet the ultimate safe haven, it’s clearly moved beyond its speculative roots and is earning a seat at the table.Part of this growing strength is structural. Over the past few years, the Bitcoin market has matured. Institutional adoption has risen. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now live in major markets. Custody solutions are better. And perhaps most importantly, there’s a broader understanding of what Bitcoin represents. Bitcoin is not just a speculative coin anymore. It’s a tool for financial sovereignty, for hedging against fiat depreciation and for stepping outside the boundaries of politicized financial infrastructure.There’s also the fact that Bitcoin is entirely non-sovereign. In a trade war scenario, where fiat currencies can be weaponized, and capital controls are deployed, Bitcoin becomes very attractive to people who want to move money across borders without interference. It’s portable, permissionless and increasingly liquid. These are three attributes of an asset you want in a crisis.Of course, none of this means Bitcoin is now the undisputed king of safe havens. Gold still plays that role for most of the world’s conservative investors. The US dollar is still the default when people want liquidity in a crunch. And Bitcoin’s price swings can still make people nervous. But you are seeing it graduate amid the market chaos. It’s no longer the outsider it once was.                  Bitcoin in times of crisis, safe haven 2.0?              In both 2019 and 2025, Bitcoin showed flashes of safe-haven behavior, proving it can act as a hedge in times of geopolitical stress. While it’s not gold just yet, its unique properties make it an increasingly serious contender in the global financial playbook.During both the 2019 trade tensions and the 2025 tariff escalation, Bitcoin acted more like a hedge than it did in earlier cycles. And that’s noteworthy. Even if Bitcoin doesn’t yet consistently play the safe-haven role, it’s starting to show it can, at least in specific contexts.There’s a bigger question brewing here, too. What does it mean for financial markets if Bitcoin does become a mainstream safe-haven asset? How does that change portfolio construction, risk models or even geopolitical strategy? After all, Bitcoin isn’t gold. It plays by entirely different rules.Bitcoin is programmable. It can be moved across the world instantly. It can be sliced into satoshis and embedded into smart contracts. If it becomes part of the global toolkit for navigating crises, that changes the game. So, is Bitcoin the new safe haven during trade wars? Not quite, at least not in the traditional sense. But it has undoubtedly earned a seat at the table. Bitcoin may not be the asset your grandparents bought to protect themselves in uncertain times, but for a growing number of investors, especially in the digital age, it’s becoming their version of safety. As geopolitical tensions rise and confidence in traditional financial systems erodes, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a potential hedge for the future.",https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-bitcoin-the-new-safe-haven-during-trade-wars?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Cheong wrote: “You don’t know whether the price is a result of organic demand & supply or simply due to projects and market makers colluding to fix the price to achieve other objectives.”He added that if the industry’s players don’t step up and improve the situation, a big part of the crypto market will remain “uninvestable for the foreseeable future.”Centralized exchanges turning a “blind eye” Cheong said it was strange that centralized exchanges (CEXs) are “turning an absolute blind eye” to the issue. He described the altcoin market as a “lemon’s market,” a term in economics that describes a market where low-quality products drive out the good due to information asymmetry.In addition, Cheong described most token generation event pricing in 2025 as an “absolute joke” where the assets’ prices went down by 70% to 90% a few months after listing. “Anyone that bought is down massively,” Cheong added. Related: Binance, KuCoin, MEXC report service issues due to AWS network interruption88% of crypto tokens listed on Binance in 2025 declined after listing Data compiled by crypto analyst Miles Deutscher showed that among crypto tokens listed this year on the trading platform Binance, only 3 out of 27 are performing well. This means that 88% of the tokens have declined since listing. The price drops ranged from 19% up to 90%. Deutscher said this was the reason why retail investors were quitting. Only 3 out of 27 tokens listed in Binance in 2025 are in the green.

The X user added that they hoped Binance would realize starting at a high valuation wasn’t good for users. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao previously admitted that Binance’s listing process needs reform. On Feb. 10, the former Binance CEO said that the current system is flawed and suggested that CEXs should automate listings similar to how decentralized exchanges (DEXs) work. Magazine: New ‘MemeStrategy’ Bitcoin firm by 9GAG, jailed CEO’s $3.5M bonus: Asia Express",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-uninvestable-if-exchanges-ignore-manipulation-defiance-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

According to the central bank’s database, the rest of the providers are classified as non-operational. The data showed that at least 22 non-operational providers have failed to meet most of the country’s Bitcoin Law requirements, which mandate that providers implement stringent supervision of their financial systems. Most of El Salvador’s Bitcoin service providers are non-operationalEl Salvador’s Bitcoin Law requires providers to maintain an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program, keep records that accurately reflect the company’s assets, liabilities and equity and have a tailored cybersecurity program depending on the nature of its services. The data showed that 89% of the registered providers have failed to meet some of these obligations to be classified as operational. Still, a few firms have satisfied the legal criteria, including the state-backed Chivo Wallet and companies including Crypto Trading & Investment and Fintech Américas.Related: Cathie Wood to kick off El Salvador’s AI public education programEl Salvador’s Bitcoin experimentIn 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender along with the US dollar.

The shift highlights Bitcoin’s “apparent growing resilience amid macroeconomic turbulence.“Founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich, told Cointelegraph that he expects this to be a temporary trend:“As the trade war intensifies, Bitcoin may return to the list of risky assets. Because investors will most likely look for salvation in gold.“Obchakevich said that factors that caused the stability of Bitcoin were growing institutional interest through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the promotion of Bitcoin as digital gold due to its decentralization and independence.Related: Bitcoin traders target $90K as apparent tariff exemptions ease US Treasury yieldsA change in Bitcoin market dynamicsOver the past week, Bitcoin’s price increased by 7% to $83,700 — later reaching nearly $86,000 at the time of publication.

These countries will then have to find a way to fend off their weak growth issues.”Wintermute explained that the ongoing trade war heightens the risk of increased inflation and economic slowdown.

However, during the interview, Tactical Investing left their screen switched off while Gallen’s was on, enabling the installation of malware called “GOOPDATE,” which stole credentials and accessed his crypto wallets. Cointelegraph reached out to the X account for comment. Zoom remote access threat“For this scam to take place, its said that the guest of the Zoom video call allows remote access to the host of the call, which is a requestable feature that is DEFAULT ON for every Zoom account,” said Gallen.NFT collector Leonidas confirmed the default settings and advised those in the crypto industry to prevent remote access. “If you don't do this, anybody who is on a Zoom call with your employees can take over their entire computer by default,” he said. Source: LeonidasSEAL security researcher Samczsun told Cointelegraph that Zoom, by default, allows meeting participants to request remote control access. “At this point in time we believe the victim still needs to be social engineered into granting access,” they said. Cointelegraph reached out to Zoom for comments but did not receive an immediate response. Related: Crypto founders report deluge of North Korean fake Zoom hacking attemptsGallen also stated that the hackers accessed his Ledger wallet even though he had only logged in a few times over the three years and had never written the password down anywhere digitally. They also hacked his X account in an attempt to lure in other victims through private messages. SEAL reported that ELUSIVE COMET is known to operate Aureon Capital, which claims to be a legitimate venture capital firm. The threat actor is responsible for “millions of dollars in stolen funds” and poses a significant risk to users due to their “carefully engineered backstory,” the firm noted. Samczsun advised users who have interacted with Aureon Capital to contact SEAL’s emergency hotline on Telegram. Magazine: Bitcoin eyes $100K by June, Shaq to settle NFT lawsuit, and more: Hodler’s Digest",https://cointelegraph.com/news/emblem-vault-ceo-loses-75-assets-in-elusive-comet-scam?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It said that during the decline, its high net-worth members “actively bought the dip,” reflecting these members’ “commitment to the long-term potential of Bitcoin.”In the first quarter of 2025, Bitcoin had its worst start to a year since 2018, closing the quarter down 13%. The crypto-friendly bank became the first licensed bank to launch interest-bearing Bitcoin and fiat banking accounts in the UK in 2025 and launched Bitcoin-backed USD loans of up to $1 million in March 2025.Xapo Bank’s self-selected poll on X showed respondents favored using Bitcoin for savings and investment.

This shift comes as European cryptocurrency exchanges moved to delist Tether in order to comply with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulations.“Xapo Bank member data shows that despite short-term headwinds, the bigger picture for Bitcoin remains strong and current volatility does not diminish Bitcoin's importance,” said Gadi Chait, Xapo Bank’s head of investment. Chait added that “while global events painted an erratic picture, the opportunity for Bitcoin has always been in its long-term performance, not its short-term volatility.”Related: Exclusive: Inside a Swiss nuclear bunker’s secret Bitcoin vaultCrypto exchange Bitget also sees Q1 trading volumes surgeMarket turmoil also prompted a flurry of activity on digital currency exchange Bitget, according to its Q1 2025 Transparency Report. Bitget’s total trading volume hit $2.1 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, as spot trading volume saw a quarter-on-quarter increase of 159%, rising to $387 billion.This surge in trading volume came as Bitget’s total user base grew by almost 20%, with the exchange adding an additional 4.89 million users on its centralized exchange and 15 million users on its Bitget Wallet app — bringing its total global user count to over 120 million.Bitget’s CEO, Gracy Chen, said the exchange will continue to “focus on institutional-grade infrastructure and double down on expanding its Web3 presence through our ecosystem.”In February, Bitget loaned rival exchange Bybit 40,000 ETH, valued at approximately $100 million, after Bybit suffered a major hack.

You gotta build about five more places.” Source: Nayib BukeleSince taking office, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of alleged foreign criminal individuals to El Salvador under a $6 million deal between the countries.Trump also addressed the ongoing trade war unleashed by his administration on April 2, suggesting a potential temporary exemption for automakers aimed at easing the transition of their supply chains.“I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters present at the meeting, adding that the US auto industry “need[s] a little bit of time” to relocate production to the country. The meeting did not touch on digital assets and Bitcoin (BTC) policy — a flagship initiative of both presidents’ administrations. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, pioneering the Bitcoin strategic reserve approach later followed by Trump. The US president positioned himself as a pro-crypto candidate during the 2024 election. On March 6, Trump signed an executive order to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile in the United States.

On April 11, the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced that 14 crypto exchanges were blocked on the Apple store. Among the affected exchanges are KuCoin and MEXC.The report, which was made public on April 14, says the banned exchanges were allegedly operating as unregistered overseas virtual asset operators. The report also states that the Financial Information Analysis Institution (FIU) will continue to promote the blocking of the apps and internet sites of such operators to prevent money laundering and user damage.The request to block applications on the Apple Store comes after Google Play blocked access to several unregistered exchanges on March 26. KuCoin and MEXC were also targeted during the blocking of the Google Play apps. The FSC published a list of 22 unregistered platforms operating in the country, with 17 of them already blocked on Google's marketplace. The 17 crypto exchanges blocked on Google Play.

2025-04-14 20:15:00,Bitcoin bucks downtrend with rally to $85.8K — Are BTC bulls really back?,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $84,500 level on April 14, and the recovery appears partially fueled by the announcement of partial import tariff relief by US President Donald Trump. However, traders’ optimism faded on April 13 when it became apparent that the relaxation was temporary and that tariffs on the electronics supply chain could be revisited.Uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China impacted Bitcoin markets, causing traders to lose some of their regained confidence. This explains why Bitcoin’s price failed to break above $86,000 and why BTC derivatives showed limited short-term potential, potentially setting the tone for the next few days.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chThe premium on Bitcoin monthly futures contracts peaked at 6.5% on April 11 but has since dropped to 5%, which is near a neutral to bearish threshold. Sellers typically require a 5% to 10% annualized premium for longer settlement periods, so anything below this range indicates reduced interest from leveraged buyers.Bitcoin sentiment dims as stock market ties dent bullish momentumTraders’ brief excitement can be linked to President Trump’s April 13 announcement that tariffs on imported semiconductors would be reviewed during the week. This suggests that exemptions for smartphones and computers are not final, according to Yahoo Finance. Trump reportedly said: “We want to make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country.”Bitcoin traders experienced emotional swings during this period of fluctuating expectations. The performance of broader markets, particularly large technology companies reliant on global trade, appears to have influenced Bitcoin sentiment. The strong intraday correlation between Bitcoin and stock markets has dampened bullish enthusiasm, leaving open questions about whether this effect is limited to BTC futures.S&P 500 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphTo determine whether Bitcoin traders’ sentiment is merely mirroring trends in the S&P 500, it is helpful to examine the BTC options markets.

However, this momentum did not hold on April 14, reinforcing data from Bitcoin futures that show no significant bullish sentiment despite prices recovering from the $74,440 lows.Weak spot Bitcoin ETF inflows also behind traders’ limited optimismAnother way to gauge market sentiment is by analyzing stablecoin demand in China. Strong retail interest in cryptocurrencies usually pushes stablecoins to trade at a premium of 2% or more above the official US dollar rate. In contrast, a premium below 0.5% often indicates fear as traders move away from crypto markets.Related: Crypto markets ‘relatively orderly’ despite Trump tariff chaos: NYDIGUSDT Tether (USDT/CNY) vs. US dollar/CNY.

However, this trend reversed, with the premium now at just 0.5%, suggesting that the earlier excitement has dissipated. Hence, traders remain cautious and show little confidence in Bitcoin surpassing $90,000 in the near term.The announcement of Strategy’s $286 million Bitcoin acquisition at $82,618 failed to boost sentiment, as investors suspect that the recent temporary decoupling from stock market trends was largely driven by this purchase.

2025-04-14 19:23:03,Bitcoin surge to $137K by Q3 possible if US Treasury continues liquidity injections — Analysts,Cointelegraph,"The US Treasury has injected $500 billion into financial markets since February by drawing liquidity from its Treasury General Account (TGA), funding government operations after a $36 trillion debt ceiling was hit on Jan. 2, 2025.Macroeconomic financial analyst Tomas said that this liquidity surge boosted the net Federal Reserve liquidity to $6.3 trillion, and it may support Bitcoin’s (BTC) price in the future, even though risk assets have reflected minimal growth so far. US Treasury General Account’s expected liquidity flow. Source: X.comThe TGA represents the government’s checking account at the Federal Reserve, holding capital for daily operations like paying bills or collecting taxes. A decrease in TGA capital means the balance has been deployed into the broader economy, boosting available cash in the markets. Tomas explained that The TGA drawdown commenced on Feb. 12, following the exhaustion of ""extraordinary measures"" after the debt ceiling was reached. The TGA balance has dropped from $842 to roughly $342 billion, releasing liquidity into the system, and the targeted liquidity is expected to rise up to $600 billion by the end of April. The analyst added that the current tax season will temporarily drain liquidity, but the drawdown is expected to resume in May. If debt ceiling talks extend to August, net liquidity could hit a multi-year high of $6.6 trillion, which could cause a bullish tailwind for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s correlation with global liquidity. Source: Lynalden.comAccording to a study by financial analyst Lyn Alden, Bitcoin has historically moved 83% of the time in line with global liquidity in a given 12-month period. The research termed “Bitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer” compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index with respect to global liquidity. Past TGA drawdowns in 2022 and 2023 have fueled speculative assets like Bitcoin. Thus, a $600 billion boost, plus billions more added over Q2-Q3, could lift BTC’s value if market conditions remain stable.

2025-04-14 16:56:08,Bitcoin traders target $90K as apparent tariff exemptions ease US Treasury yields,Cointelegraph,"The 2-year and 10-year US Treasury yields dipped on Monday, April 14, after Bitcoin (BTC) closed its best weekly performance since the second week of January. Bitcoin gained 6.79% over the past week, but are enough factors aligned to support continued price upside? The 10-year treasury yield declined by 8.2 basis points to 4.40% during the New York trading session, while the 2-year treasury saw an 8 basis point slip to 3.88%. The drop in yields occurred on the back of possible tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and semiconductors, which were introduced to give US companies time to move production domestically. However, US President Donald Trump emphasized these exemptions were temporary in nature.US 10-year treasury bond yields chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe tariff exemptions announced on April 12 came at the end of a bullish week for Bitcoin. After forming new yearly lows at $74,500, BTC price jumped 15% to $86,100 between April 9-13. Easing US treasury yields could be a double-edged sword for Bitcoin. Lower yields reduce the appeal for fixed-income assets, improving capital injection into risk-on assets like BTC. Still, the uncertainty of “temporary exemptions” and the ongoing trade war with China keeps Bitcoin susceptible to further price volatility. As an “inflation hedge,” Bitcoin continues to draw mixed opinions, but recent uncertainty over trade policies increases inflation fears, improving BTC’s store of value narrative. Yet, recent US inflation data suggested a cooling trend, as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March 2025 indicated a year-over-year inflation rate of 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February, marking the lowest since February 2023, which could be indirectly bearish for Bitcoin in the short term.Related: Trade war vs record M2 money supply: 5 things to know in Bitcoin this weekBitcoin price hurdles present at $88K to $90KTrading resource Material Indicators noted that Bitcoin retained a bullish position above its 50-weekly moving average and quarterly open at $82,500.

Source: X.comIn a recent X post, Wedson highlighted that this shrinking gap, currently negative, signals fading bearish sentiment, with historical trends from 2020–2021 and 2024 showing that a positive gap often leads to a Bitcoin rally. Wedson noted that a flip to a positive gap could indicate returning buyer momentum. However, he cautioned that such negative gaps persisted during the 2022–2023 bear market.Related: Michael Saylor’s Strategy buys $285M Bitcoin amid market uncertaintyThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The product in question allows institutional borrowers to access USDt (USDT) liquidity without liquidating their Bitcoin holdings at a fixed 8% borrowing cost.In February, Avalon Labs also announced that it is considering issuing a Bitcoin-backed debt-focused public fund. Venus Li, co-founder of Avalon Labs, said at the time that the fund could be issued by leveraging a Regulation A US securities exception:“We have spent years researching how Regulation A has been applied in traditional finance and whether it could be a viable path for crypto companies. While successful precedents in the crypto industry are limited, our analysis of previous SEC-approved cases suggests a viable path forward.”Related: Bitcoin yield opportunities are booming — Here’s what to watch forCentralized and decentralized finance uniteAvalon Labs’ product is a CeDeFi protocol, somewhere between decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi). This category of products — with their increased control over capital flows and access — often has some advantages in meeting the regulatory requirements for integrating with CeFi platforms.The Bybit Earn integration leverages Avalon Labs’ 1:1 Bitcoin-pegged token FBTC, developed by DeFi protocol Mantle and Bitcoin-centric crypto developer Antalpha Prime. These tokens are then bridged onto Ethereum and other blockchains.Related: Ethena Labs, Securitize launch blockchain for DeFi and tokenized assetsA multi-protocol systemAvalon Labs’ platform accepts FBTC as collateral and lends it at fixed rates.

The president also set reciprocal tariffs for countries that charge tariffs on US imports. The Trump administration then continued flip-flopping over tariff policy, bringing market uncertainty. Butterfill wrote that the “wave of negative sentiment” that started in February has resulted in record outflows of $7.2 billion.

2025-04-14 10:17:56,Google to enforce MiCA rules for crypto ads in Europe starting April 23,Cointelegraph,"Google will begin enforcing stricter advertising policies for cryptocurrency services in Europe under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, the company said in a recent policy update.The move could be a “double-edged sword” for regulation that may prevent initial coin offering (ICO) frauds, but risks further enforcement gaps, according to legal advisers.Starting April 23, cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto wallet advertising in Europe must be licensed under Europe’s MiCA framework or under the Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) regulation.Crypto advertisers on Google will also have to comply with “local legal requirements,” including “national-level restrictions or requirements beyond MiCA” and be “certified by Google,” according to a March 24 Google policy announcement.The new advertising policy will apply to most European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.Policy violations “won’t lead to immediate account suspensions,” as a warning will be issued at least seven days before any account suspensions, added Google’s policy update.The policy shift follows the implementation of the MiCA framework in December 2024, which introduced the first comprehensive regulatory structure for digital assets across the European Union.Related: EU MiCA rules pose ‘systemic’ banking risks for stablecoins — Tether CEOGoogle’s policy seen as double-edged swordGoogle’s new crypto advertising requirements present a “double-edged sword” for crypto regulation, according to Hon Ng, chief legal officer at Bitget.“On one hand, they do enhance investor protection by filtering out unregulated actors,” he told Cointelegraph.“The MiCA framework’s strict AML/CFT and transparency requirements create a safer ecosystem, reducing scams like the ICO frauds that plagued the industry pre-2023,” he said.However, Ng warned the policy could be “overly restrictive” without flexible implementation, especially since transition periods for national licensing vary across jurisdictions.Since Google’s transition period for national licenses varies by country, this may create “temporary gaps in enforcement,” and even bigger challenges around compliance costs, Ng said, adding:“Smaller exchanges may struggle with MiCA’s capital requirements (15,000–150,000 euros) or the bureaucratic hurdle of dual certification (both Google and local regulators). These measures are a net positive for trust but need flexibility to avoid stifling innovation.”Related: Most EU banks fail to meet rising crypto investor demand — SurveyOther industry watchers don’t see this as a fundamental change for Google or investor protection.The updates may be more oriented toward “protecting Google from liability than protecting the investors themselves,” according to Mattan Erder, general counsel at layer-3 decentralized blockchain network Orbs.“Any impact of this change in Google’s policy is downstream of the regulations themselves. If MiCA or CASP registration turns out to be burdensome, expensive and only accessible to big players, then smaller players will have a lot of difficulty competing in these jurisdictions,” Erder told Cointelegraph.Magazine: How crypto laws are changing across the world in 2025",https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-crypto-ads-mica-europe-compliance-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
