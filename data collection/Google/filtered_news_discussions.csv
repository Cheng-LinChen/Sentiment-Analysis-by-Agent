For outspoken Trump critic Anthony Scaramucci, that's chilling. Top business leaders, plus a slew of economists and strategists, have cautioned that Trump's combative tariff policy could lead to costly trade wars. Markets have sold off to price in that risk. And although Trump's protectionist stance on trade may be evolving with his 90-day tariff pause and exemptions on certain tech goods late last week, that's of little comfort to Scaramucci. After all, the president could easily change his mind again, with little to no pushback. ""There's one drum beating in the White House: Donald Trump beats to his own drum,"" Scaramucci told Business Insider in a recent interview. ""There are no other drum beats in the White House. You can fall in line and sing from his chorus sheet, you can fall in line and praise him at a cabinet meeting — or you can get fired. Those are your choices."" Scaramucci is speaking from experience. The founder of SkyBridge Capital worked as Trump's communications director for just 11 days in the first term before getting fired — a fact he often finds amusing. But Scaramucci has little reason to joke around. The so-called ""guardrails"" he thought would keep Trump's impulses in check are missing, in his view, which he sees as no laughing matter. The former White House comms director claimed that Trump tried to revamp US trade policy in his first term — and got shut down. ""What happens is, Trump had six, seven, eight people that were ready to give him 'the Heisman' in 2018 when he tried to pull this — and he got scared,"" Scaramucci said of the trade dispute, referring to the iconic college football trophy featuring a player in a stiff-arm pose. Scaramucci continued: ""He wasn't as confident as he was as president today. Trump term one — a less confident Trump, a more vulnerable Trump. Lots of people in the White House that were garden-variety Republicans, or just common-sense economists — whether it was a Steven Mnuchin or somebody like Gary Cohn — and he extinguished all those people."" The Trump administration's tariff policy outlines several goals, including closing trade deficits and bringing jobs, investment, and manufacturing back to the US. White House spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider: ""Anthony Scaramucci is a fraud and a disgraced clown with no standing to comment on President Trump's historic action to finally address the national emergency posed by our country's chronic trade deficits."" Desai continued: ""President Trump has assembled the best and most experienced trade and economic team in modern history who are working diligently to implement an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy to restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street."" What worries Scaramucci isn't necessarily that Trump is in office, though that wasn't his choice — it's that Republicans aren't challenging the policies that the political pundit says will be harmful. This reminds him of the folktale ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" where no one is willing to speak truth to the leader. ""He's surrounded by sycophants — he's loaded with power,"" Scaramucci said. ""And this goes back to first-grade literature. Sometime in the first grade, you read 'the Emperor has no clothes.' And as a seven-year-old, you were like, 'Well, that's stupid. Why would anybody tell somebody that they have clothes on when there's no clothes?'"" Scaramucci continued: ""And now you're learning in 2025 that there are billionaires and centimillionaires that will stand in the cabinet room and tell somebody that they have clothes on, when they have no clothes."" Shortly after Trump was elected, Scaramucci told Business Insider that he couldn't rule out a 1920s-style stock-market crash — even though he admitted it wasn't his base case. A few months later, the S&P 500 suffered through one of its biggest two-day sell-offs ever as a global trade war became a more realistic risk. Scaramucci said Trump deserves all the blame. ""If Kamala Harris took $14 trillion out of the global stock markets, crushed our relationship with all of our trading partners, alienated us from our allies, what do you think would've happened?"" Scaramucci said. ""Do you Fox News would've said, 'This is 19-D chess, and we're into 17 different dimensional planes of brilliance?'"" Scaramucci suspects that Trump's trade negotiations will be unsuccessful for three key reasons. First, aggressive tariffs could cause a recession — both because they'll cost consumers money, and since other countries will likely retaliate with their own tariffs that weigh on US exports. Tariffs are taxes on imports that buyers bear, so it's no surprise that consumer confidence is spiraling. According to Rosenberg Research, Americans recently said the likelihood of their income increasing in the next year is 35%, the lowest rate since 2011. Just as troubling is that inflation expectations are surging, which could lead to a dreaded stagflation scenario. Those troubles could quickly compound if tariffs escalate and result in a full-blown trade war. That could cripple US businesses, which is the opposite of Trump's stated aim. Also, Scaramucci said the US would be unlikely to win such a dispute after burning its key allies. Nations that were once friendly, including those in Europe, may now turn to rivals like China. ""If you want to start a trade war with me, I'm going to retaliate, and I'm going to up the ante with you,"" Scaramucci said. ""Moreover, I'm going to deal with people that I wouldn't typically deal with."" This leads to what Scaramucci sees as Trump's final miscalculation on trade. The pundit said that the president has not only burdened US consumers and businesses while alienating allies but also underestimated the Chinese Communist Party's pain tolerance. ""The Chinese are very well prepared for this, and Trump doesn't understand their culture,"" Scaramucci said. ""They're not going to want to lose face."" Trump and China's Xi Jinping are both resolute. It may seem like the US has more leverage since China exports far more goods, but it's worth noting that China's authoritarian government has few checks on its power and operates on a plan measured in decades and centuries. By contrast, Trump is term-limited and has less than four years to try to execute his master plan — even if Scaramucci wishes he wouldn't. Jump to",2025-04-15,25

https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capital-markets-currencies/multibillion-dollar-exodus-hits-china-etfs-amid-trump-tariff-war,Multibillion dollar exodus hits China ETFs amid Trump tariff war - The Business Times,"Search Follow [SAO PAULO] Investors are dumping exchange-traded funds tracking Chinese stocks at a record pace as the world’s biggest economies face off in an escalating trade war that is set to challenge global growth.  Outflows from US-listed emerging market ETFs that invest across developing nations, as well as those that target specific countries, totalled US$5.57 billion in the week ended Apr 11, the most in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that total, US$3.69 billion came from China. The US$5.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF recorded US$1.2 billion in outflows last week, while the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF saw more than US$1 billion in withdrawals and the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF recorded US$780 million in redemptions. In each case, the outflows were records. Meanwhile, a popular ex-China fund hasn’t seen inflows since September.  “The combination of tariff escalation and negative speculative rhetoric around Chinese ADRs led to capitulation on China specific ETFs last week,” said Malcolm Dorson, senior portfolio manager at Global X Management. “This could continue unless we see the two sides begin to find some common ground.” Trade tensions between the world’s biggest economies have whipsawed global markets and stoked concern over global growth this month. Last week, Beijing retaliated against Trump’s latest tariffs by hiking duties on all US goods to 125 per cent, while calling the administration’s actions a “joke.” The White House set 145 per cent levies on Chinese goods. “If it’s a scenario where the Trump administration maintains very high tariffs on China, it’s clearly negative for China’s growth this year and over the medium term,” said Michael Hirson, head of China Strategy for 22V Research. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. While China said it won’t match any further hikes, it reiterated its vow to “fight to the end” with other, unspecified countermeasures. The impact of this escalting trade war will likely begin to materialise from this month. The escalating trade war and its potential implications on China’s growth is raising questions among investors on which steps will be taken by policymakers to defend the economy. Last week, top leaders from China discussed additional economic stimulus in response to Trump’s tariffs, which could include measures to boost consumer spending, the birth rate and subsidies for some exports. Still, the scale and timing of new stimulus are yet to be finalised, while questions on whether that will be enough to support the Asian nation remain. “Part of the calculation is the need to save policy room for what comes down the road,” Hirson said.

Edward Jones PFS Trade war uncertainty has put stock markets on edge as tariffs have been announced, delayed, implemented, and paused. While we may see lots of short-term market volatility, it may not have a meaningful long-term market impact. Why the optimism? Because the market impact of the 2018-2019 US-China trade war subsided quickly once a resolution was reached. Trade war uncertainty has put stock markets on edge over the past several weeks as the Trump administration has announced, delayed, implemented, and paused tariffs. (In that time, other countries have retaliated with their own tariffs.) As events unfold, it's important to look back at the market response to the tariff wars in the first Trump administration. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it can rhyme — and the 2018-2019 trade war is arguably the best guide we have. The 2018-2019 trade war between the US and China had a significant impact on the US economy. It caused disruptions, price increases (which squeezed some businesses’ profit margins), and elevated uncertainty, which led to stalled US business investment and hiring. Here are just some of the observations from Federal Reserve Beige Books during this period: The 2018-2019 tariff war also had a significant impact on markets, taking them on a roller coaster ride. It led to higher volatility as ups and downs were dictated by news flow on trade talks and the removal of tariffs/application of more tariffs. In general, there was a flight to perceived ‘safe haven’ assets globally. In other words, tariffs caused short-term headwinds. Once markets grew accustomed to them and then a resolution was reached as the Phase I trade deal between the US and China was announced, volatility eased and financial markets reaccelerated. In this episode, we get an economist’s perspective on what tariffs could mean for growth, inflation, and markets. We also talk about what’s driving the recent outperformance of European stocks and the main indicator to watch regarding US inflation.  Brian Levitt: Welcome to Invesco's Greater Possibilities podcast. I'm Brian Levitt, and with me as always is Jodi Phillips. Hey, Jodi. Jodi Phillips: Hey, Brian. So today we're going to be covering quite a few segments once again, including reaching out to our friend Turgut Kışınbay, who's the chief US economist for Invesco Fixed Income. We're going to be asking Turgut for his thoughts on tariffs and their impact on the economy and markets. Brian Levitt: The news flow been fast enough for you, Jodi? Jodi Phillips: I could use a moment or two to process everything, to be honest. Brian Levitt: Just a few? Jodi Phillips: Just a few. I mean, we went straight from the DeepSeek news to some on again, off again, tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and then 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, and then a hotter than expected US inflation report for January. If that wasn't enough in the background, I've been trying to remember my football trivia and markets, whether the markets have done better when the NFC or the AFC wins the championship. Brian Levitt: I always forget that one. What did you learn? Jodi Phillips: Well, the good news is it does better when the NFC teams come out on top. Brian Levitt: Okay. Happy with that. Jodi Phillips: Yeah. Brian Levitt: You sound a little concerned. Is there any bad news there? Jodi Phillips: Well, yeah, there's sort of like a Philadelphia based footnote to that. Yeah, some maybe bad things happen when Philadelphia teams win championships. Brian Levitt: Besides my feelings being hurt? Jodi Phillips: Well, yeah, no, not the optimal outcome for a Giants fan, but I'm talking about the markets. So consider this: in baseball, first of all, the Philadelphia Athletics were the top team in 1929. Brian Levitt: 29, okay. Before the Depression. Jodi Phillips: Yes. And the Phillies won it all in 2008. Brian Levitt: Okay. Global financial crisis, we're doing great here. Jodi Phillips: Right, right. Switching to football, the Eagles won in 2018, and of course this year. So, yeah. Brian Levitt: Good to know. I think I'm going to try to not put too much credence into that. I'll stick to the usual models, rather than the Philadelphia sports teams. Jodi Phillips: Good idea, good idea. Brian Levitt: Good news is 1929 and 2008, years in which the economy was pretty over levered. I'd say that is not the case today. Interesting though. Maybe 2018 makes a little bit more sense. Back then we had concerns about tariffs, even the potential for the Fed to raise rates back then. Jodi Phillips: Raising rates. You don't think that's going to happen, do you? Brian Levitt: No, no. I can't get there. I know some people talk about it. I just can't get there and I think the bar's pretty high for the Fed. Jodi Phillips: I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. And of course on the tariff conversation, as I mentioned, we'll be talking to Turgut in a moment. But before that, let's start with our first topic. Speaker 3: Trending Conversations. Jodi Phillips: Okay, Brian, so what's on everyone's mind? Brian Levitt: You mean besides the success of the Philadelphia teams and the market? Jodi Phillips: Yes, besides that. Besides that. Brian Levitt: So I am going to go with the trending conversation right now is the broadening of the market. Jodi Phillips: So it's happening, this is it? Brian Levitt: It's all happening. Jodi Phillips: Nice. So it's not just a Magnificent Seven this year, then? We're going to get performance from the Unmagnificent 493. Should we call them that? I feel like we need a different name. That's- Brian Levitt: Yeah, I'm sure they'd all be very happy to be called the Unmagnificent. I think it's actually 495. Aren't there 502 companies in the S&P? Jodi Phillips: I'd defer to you. Brian Levitt: Well, whatever, something like that. But yeah, it's more like the parts of the market that hadn't performed in a while have had a very nice start to the year. I'll include mid-cap stocks, value stocks, and this one might surprise you, Jodi, European stocks. So it's MEEGA, Make European Equities Great Again. Jodi Phillips: I'm going to have to track a whole different kind of football trivia if this is the case. So why do you think that is? Why do you think that is? What's going on here? Brian Levitt: I'd say a few things. I'll start with the top down. It's a higher nominal growth environment than we've been in for a long while. Meaning real GDP (gross domestic product) is good in the US, higher inflation, which some people worry about, I think is good. So that adds up to higher nominal growth, and that could benefit value-oriented stocks, smaller capitalization stocks. We always talk about, what can unlock the value, and higher nominal growth can help to do that. Jodi Phillips: All right. So the higher tide lifts more boats, that saying. Brian Levitt: Yeah, and some of it also would be policy-related. We always say, ""Don't fight the Fed."" Well, we don't want to fight the ECB, the Bank of England, and everybody else. So ECB, European Central Bank, is lowering rates, that's providing support to European stocks. We've seen some stimulus out of China. I'd also remind this idea about mid-caps, when the Trump administration came in people were excited about deregulation. Well guess which companies tend to face the highest regulation? Those tend to be mid-cap stocks. And also some optimism around mergers and acquisitions. If we're going to get this wave, that should benefit mid-caps also. Jodi Phillips: Great. So do you think the broader market performance that we're talking about here, can that be sustained? Brian Levitt: Yeah, so that's the optimistic view, but our base case is optimistic. So that's the idea. And investors right now, I think they want to participate, but they feel like perhaps the market's gotten ahead of itself or somewhat overvalued. Well, that's just one part of the market, that's the S&P 500. So it's not about blowing out of those big tech names, but think about the big tech names, and what else can we have in our portfolios. Jodi Phillips: Okay. So for the investors who maybe have grown a little bit tired of waiting for broad market performance, I mean we have kind of heard this before. What's the one thing you would tell them that might make it different this time? Brian Levitt: I would say it's been a long while since we've had a good nominal growth backdrop, but also a Fed that was preparing to gradually lower rates. I mean, think about it, for more than 20 years the Fed has either been raising rates or quickly taking rates to zero to respond to a crisis. So this is different, maybe a slower, gradual easing environment can help unlock some value that exists in parts of the market. Jodi Phillips: Okay. So that can support a broader market, so that's the idea then. Sounds- Brian Levitt: That's the idea. Jodi Phillips: We'll take it. All right, moving on to the next topic. Speaker 3: Phone A Friend. Jodi Phillips: So each episode we're reaching out to a friend of the podcast for a deeper dive on topics that are at the top of investors' minds. Tariffs, no big surprise. We reached out to Turgut Kışınbay, chief US economist at Invesco Fixed income, for his views on tariffs and the potential impact on the economy and markets. And it was a really great wide-ranging conversation, so we're going to bring in a couple different clips on what Turgut had to say. First, we asked him if tariffs are more of an inflation concern or a growth concern. And here's what he said. Turgut Kışınbay: I think tariffs can be both an inflation and a growth concern. So I'm not really worried about the sustained inflation when it comes to tariffs, but it can be a one-off increase in the price level. And the central banks are supposed to see through that, but that's easy to say in theory. But in practice it may not be easy for the Fed to respond, because if the last couple of weeks is an indication, tariffs will be used as a negotiating tool. It can be on and off, that we have tariffs on and then off, and then they're sustained at different countries, different sectors. So for the Fed it'll be a bit difficult to figure which part is transitory, and they have been burned by transitory, and which part is sustained. So I think it is not a sustained inflation risk, but it is still something difficult to manage for the Fed. So, in my view, it can just delay Fed easing cycle a little bit. Jodi Phillips: So then we asked whether the markets have become a little bit too complacent, perhaps, thinking that tariffs might just be a negotiating tool, an on-again off-again thing. So here's his thoughts on that. Turgut Kışınbay: I think the market may be a little complacent on the tariffs. So far I think the market is assuming that this is just going to be a negotiating tool. So just like maybe Colombia is an example that tariffs will be used as a threat, and then a couple of days later it's not implemented. But I think going forward that may not be the case. We'll get into more economic tariffs against autos, against countries with large trade deficits, that US has large trade deficits. Eventually tariffs will come, and I think that that will have an impact on growth, inflation, and even business confidence. Jodi Phillips: And then finally we asked for investors thinking about the type of risk profile they might want in their portfolio, if he thinks tariffs might bring about the end of the business cycle or whether it may create a less optimal outcome for the economy. And here's what he had to say about that. Turgut Kışınbay: I think tariffs create a bit of a more volatile investment environment rather than necessarily like a bearish market. It's just going to be more volatile. I think US economy is quite resilient and tariffs will be again, if they're implemented aggressively, a challenging environment for consumers and maybe some companies who are importing intermediate goods. But I think US economy has proven that it's quite resilient, and I think the policymakers will be sensitive to the economy, and if they see any signs of consumer or business concerns they will basically, maybe not reverse, or go slower, or do something about it. So it's not like I think they will just go ahead blindly and just implement tariffs across the board. But given what we are seeing over the last couple of weeks, that is a more, it is a change. It's a new government. It is a new government that is basically changing the rules of the game compared to the previous decades. So it's a more uncertain environment and there's going to be some volatility. There are going to be winners and losers, but I wouldn't expect an across the board decline in risk assets or a recession in the economy. Jodi Phillips: All right, thank you Turgut for joining us. So our next topic is... Speaker 3: The Inbox Jodi Phillips: So here's where I go to the mail bag, so to speak, and select a question that listeners have had for Brian. You can always reach out to Brian on X or LinkedIn, @BrianLevitt. So, are you ready? Brian Levitt: Yeah, I'm ready. Jodi Phillips: All right, here's the question. What can we watch to determine if inflation is again becoming a problem? Brian Levitt: Price of eggs? Jodi Phillips: Yeah, I just bought some yesterday, so that's top of mind for me. But I thought we strip out food and energy prices when making the determination on inflation. Brian Levitt: Yeah, I think we should. Actually, the price of eggs is a perfect example of that. I'm always asked by people, ""Why do they strip out food and energy? Does the Federal Reserve, do they not drive? Do they not eat?"" They do, I think. They just don't want to be setting policy based on things that are idiosyncratic to the broad inflation picture. So for example, egg prices have risen significantly because of a breakout of avian influenza, bird flu. Jodi Phillips: Bird flu. All right. So that obviously has led to a significant reduction in the egg-laying hen population. But you're saying that's not a reason to raise interest rates? Brian Levitt: No, no, no. Culling the chicken population or the hen population should not be a reason to raise interest rates. Again, that's precisely why they strip out food and energy. It's about broad-based pricing pressure, not these idiosyncratic things. Jodi Phillips: Okay, okay. Then the real answer then, what should investors watch? Brian Levitt: So I'm watching the ten-year US inflation break even, which we may want to define. Jodi Phillips: Sure. All right. The difference in yield between a ten-year Treasury note and a ten-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security. So essentially that's what the market is expecting from inflation, yes? Brian Levitt: Yeah. And the reason we use the long term is because it's going to kind of ignore some of those near-term shocks, like a spike in the price of eggs, or a spike in the price of auto insurance, or some of the things that have been happening. And so what the Federal Reserve wants is price stability, they want to make sure that long-term inflation expectations aren't becoming unmoored. So right now, long-term inflation expectations are sitting at around 2.5%. That seems okay. And if you break out of that, then the Federal Reserve may need to respond to it. That's something to watch. But as of now, it's sitting within what we would all perceive to be a comfort zone. Jodi Phillips: All right. So let's conclude with our last segment where we put Brian on... Speaker 3: The Hot Seat. Jodi Phillips: I'll ask Brian some quick questions and he must answer in as concise a fashion as he can. So, let's go. Are you surprised that market volatility has remained low? Brian Levitt: No, not necessarily. I mean, we talk about policy uncertainty, and market volatility tends to be driven by policy uncertainty. I think the markets right now, at least on the monetary side, feel comfortable with the Fed being on hold. So not a significant amount of uncertainty there. So trade uncertainty remains but the market has been comforted, at least for now, by the president having used the potential tariffs on Canada and Mexico as a starting point, a negotiating tactic, rather than something we were going to follow through with. So yeah, to the extent you get some additional uncertainty around those things, yeah, you could see some market volatility, but I'm not shocked that we haven't seen significant amount now. Jodi Phillips: Great. All right. I think you answered this question a little bit earlier on, but we'll ask again. Why the great start to the year for European stocks? Brian Levitt: Yeah, it's never about good or bad, investors need to remember that sometimes you just get these conditions where things are getting a little bit better. And the bar was set low. Say sentiment is improving as the European Central Bank lowers rates to support growth. And I would add to that, we'll see where these negotiations between Russia and the US over Ukraine go, but it seems to be a little bit of a wake-up call that the Europeans want to increase defense spending, that they may want to issue debt collectively. And so those are things that investors have wanted to see and could help to support growth. Jodi Phillips: Okay. All right. So, next question, we all know how much you like your market milestones. Brian Levitt: I do. Jodi Phillips: We talked last episode about Bitcoin at a hundred thousand, for example. So now, this time, what's your take on gold nearing $3,000 per troy ounce? Brian Levitt: Well, my take is, I've missed the whole thing. But that's okay, because the stock market has done fine as well. You know what's really interesting about gold, it's happened as real yields have risen. So I was always taught that if you can get a positive real yield in Treasuries, why gold? So this is a little bit different. I would say it's being driven by a few things, central bank demand, so particularly from China as they diversify away some from the US dollar. Also, the uncertainty we just talked about with regards to trade. So yeah, gold continues to get a bid. Jodi Phillips: All right, and that brings us to the end of another episode. So Brian, before we go, remind our listeners where they can follow you. Brian Levitt: Yeah. Thanks, Jodi. Visit invesco.com/brianlevitt to read my latest commentaries. I'm being told that I'm being paid by the click now, so help a friend out. I kid, of course. Of course you could follow me on LinkedIn and on X @BrianLevitt. Jodi Phillips: Thanks for joining.

In general, stock values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. Stocks of small- and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale. A value style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns will trail other styles of investing or the overall stock markets. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. Fluctuations in the price of gold and precious metals may affect the profitability of companies in the gold and precious metals sector. Changes in the political or economic conditions of countries where companies in the gold and precious metals sector are located may have a direct effect on the price of gold and precious metals. Bitcoins are considered a highly speculative investment due to their lack of guaranteed value and limited track record. Because of their digital nature, they pose risks from hackers, malware, fraud, and operational glitches. Bitcoins aren't legal tender and are operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin accounts aren't backed or insured by any type of federal or government program or bank. Bitcoin is a digital currency (also called cryptocurrency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government. Bitcoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept bitcoins as payment. Investments in companies located or operating in Greater China are subject to the following risks: nationalization, expropriation, or confiscation of property, difficulty in obtaining and/or enforcing judgments, alteration or discontinuation of economic reforms, military conflicts, and China’s dependency on the economies of other Asian countries, many of which are developing countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. An issuer may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer’s credit rating. Monetary easing refers to the lowering of interest rates and deposit ratios by central banks. GDP stands for gross domestic product, which is a broad indicator of a region’s economic activity, measuring the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced in that region over a specified period of time. Idiosyncratic developments refer to unique events that do not affect an entire market or portfolio. Inflation is the rate at which the general price level for goods and services is increasing. The Magnificent Seven stocks refer to Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Stocks of medium-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale. Real yields are the returns that a bond investor earns from interest payments after accounting for inflation. A risk asset is generally described as any financial security or instrument that carries risk and is likely to fluctuate in price. Stagflation is an economic condition marked by a combination of slow economic growth and rising prices. A troy ounce is a unit of measurement used to weigh precious metals  The Greater Possibilities Podcast is brought to you by Invesco Distributors, Inc. Protectionist measures have tended to result in less optimal economic growth globally in the near term but have not necessarily served as a long-term hurdle for the stock market. So why have markets reacted so negatively knowing recent history? I think because many assumed the Trump administration would be focused on keeping stocks buoyant and would threaten tariffs rather than actually implement them. Also, this time around the tariff war is bigger — it's being fought on multiple fronts simultaneously. However, I think markets will adjust, then experience a hiccup if more tariffs are levied, and so on and so on, like what we saw in the first Trump administration. I expect volatility and downward pressure to continue until greater clarity emerges — which is hopefully sooner rather than later. We also keep getting asked whether the US should be worried about higher inflation or lower growth with tariffs. In the near term, tariffs cause price increases, but they tend to quickly subside as tariffs are removed (which is why I have argued vehemently that when it comes to inflation, we should be far more worried about immigration policy) so they don’t typically result in sustainable inflation. However, tariffs can suppress demand. So I believe growth is a far bigger issue — and it’s the risk we need to worry about if tariffs stay on for a long period of time. Also, retaliation magnifies and globalizes the effects of tariffs, meaning the global economy could end up with less growth and higher inflation. Keep in mind that the US may have less to lose than any one trading partner, but when the war is fought against a range of partners, the cumulative damage on the US economy could be greater than on any one partner. In addition, we have tariff wars going on at the same time that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort is attempting to rapidly and dramatically cut government spending. As I have said before, this could be very negative for the US economy in the near term. We’ll want to keep an eye on signs of any kind of deterioration in sentiment or spending plans resulting from the current environment.

https://www.businessinsider.com/anthony-scaramucci-trump-tariff-trade-policy-economy-recession-europe-china-2025-4,"Anthony Scaramucci Explains Why Trump Tariffs, Trade Policy Will Fail - Business Insider","The future of the global economy may hinge on President Donald Trump's trade policy decisions — and how other countries respond to them. For outspoken Trump critic Anthony Scaramucci, that's chilling. Top business leaders, plus a slew of economists and strategists, have cautioned that Trump's combative tariff policy could lead to costly trade wars. Markets have sold off to price in that risk. And although Trump's protectionist stance on trade may be evolving with his 90-day tariff pause and exemptions on certain tech goods late last week, that's of little comfort to Scaramucci. After all, the president could easily change his mind again, with little to no pushback. ""There's one drum beating in the White House: Donald Trump beats to his own drum,"" Scaramucci told Business Insider in a recent interview. ""There are no other drum beats in the White House. You can fall in line and sing from his chorus sheet, you can fall in line and praise him at a cabinet meeting — or you can get fired. Those are your choices."" Scaramucci is speaking from experience. The founder of SkyBridge Capital worked as Trump's communications director for just 11 days in the first term before getting fired — a fact he often finds amusing. But Scaramucci has little reason to joke around. The so-called ""guardrails"" he thought would keep Trump's impulses in check are missing, in his view, which he sees as no laughing matter. The former White House comms director claimed that Trump tried to revamp US trade policy in his first term — and got shut down. ""What happens is, Trump had six, seven, eight people that were ready to give him 'the Heisman' in 2018 when he tried to pull this — and he got scared,"" Scaramucci said of the trade dispute, referring to the iconic college football trophy featuring a player in a stiff-arm pose. Scaramucci continued: ""He wasn't as confident as he was as president today. Trump term one — a less confident Trump, a more vulnerable Trump. Lots of people in the White House that were garden-variety Republicans, or just common-sense economists — whether it was a Steven Mnuchin or somebody like Gary Cohn — and he extinguished all those people."" The Trump administration's tariff policy outlines several goals, including closing trade deficits and bringing jobs, investment, and manufacturing back to the US. White House spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider: ""Anthony Scaramucci is a fraud and a disgraced clown with no standing to comment on President Trump's historic action to finally address the national emergency posed by our country's chronic trade deficits."" Desai continued: ""President Trump has assembled the best and most experienced trade and economic team in modern history who are working diligently to implement an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy to restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street."" What worries Scaramucci isn't necessarily that Trump is in office, though that wasn't his choice — it's that Republicans aren't challenging the policies that the political pundit says will be harmful. This reminds him of the folktale ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" where no one is willing to speak truth to the leader. ""He's surrounded by sycophants — he's loaded with power,"" Scaramucci said. ""And this goes back to first-grade literature. Sometime in the first grade, you read 'the Emperor has no clothes.' And as a seven-year-old, you were like, 'Well, that's stupid. Why would anybody tell somebody that they have clothes on when there's no clothes?'"" Scaramucci continued: ""And now you're learning in 2025 that there are billionaires and centimillionaires that will stand in the cabinet room and tell somebody that they have clothes on, when they have no clothes."" Shortly after Trump was elected, Scaramucci told Business Insider that he couldn't rule out a 1920s-style stock-market crash — even though he admitted it wasn't his base case. A few months later, the S&P 500 suffered through one of its biggest two-day sell-offs ever as a global trade war became a more realistic risk. Scaramucci said Trump deserves all the blame. ""If Kamala Harris took $14 trillion out of the global stock markets, crushed our relationship with all of our trading partners, alienated us from our allies, what do you think would've happened?"" Scaramucci said. ""Do you Fox News would've said, 'This is 19-D chess, and we're into 17 different dimensional planes of brilliance?'"" Scaramucci suspects that Trump's trade negotiations will be unsuccessful for three key reasons. First, aggressive tariffs could cause a recession — both because they'll cost consumers money, and since other countries will likely retaliate with their own tariffs that weigh on US exports. Tariffs are taxes on imports that buyers bear, so it's no surprise that consumer confidence is spiraling. According to Rosenberg Research, Americans recently said the likelihood of their income increasing in the next year is 35%, the lowest rate since 2011. Just as troubling is that inflation expectations are surging, which could lead to a dreaded stagflation scenario. Those troubles could quickly compound if tariffs escalate and result in a full-blown trade war. That could cripple US businesses, which is the opposite of Trump's stated aim. Also, Scaramucci said the US would be unlikely to win such a dispute after burning its key allies. Nations that were once friendly, including those in Europe, may now turn to rivals like China. ""If you want to start a trade war with me, I'm going to retaliate, and I'm going to up the ante with you,"" Scaramucci said. ""Moreover, I'm going to deal with people that I wouldn't typically deal with."" This leads to what Scaramucci sees as Trump's final miscalculation on trade. The pundit said that the president has not only burdened US consumers and businesses while alienating allies but also underestimated the Chinese Communist Party's pain tolerance. ""The Chinese are very well prepared for this, and Trump doesn't understand their culture,"" Scaramucci said. ""They're not going to want to lose face."" Trump and China's Xi Jinping are both resolute. It may seem like the US has more leverage since China exports far more goods, but it's worth noting that China's authoritarian government has few checks on its power and operates on a plan measured in decades and centuries. By contrast, Trump is term-limited and has less than four years to try to execute his master plan — even if Scaramucci wishes he wouldn't. Jump to",2025-04-15,25
https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capital-markets-currencies/multibillion-dollar-exodus-hits-china-etfs-amid-trump-tariff-war,Multibillion dollar exodus hits China ETFs amid Trump tariff war - The Business Times,"Search Follow [SAO PAULO] Investors are dumping exchange-traded funds tracking Chinese stocks at a record pace as the world’s biggest economies face off in an escalating trade war that is set to challenge global growth.  Outflows from US-listed emerging market ETFs that invest across developing nations, as well as those that target specific countries, totalled US$5.57 billion in the week ended Apr 11, the most in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that total, US$3.69 billion came from China. The US$5.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF recorded US$1.2 billion in outflows last week, while the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF saw more than US$1 billion in withdrawals and the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF recorded US$780 million in redemptions. In each case, the outflows were records. Meanwhile, a popular ex-China fund hasn’t seen inflows since September.  “The combination of tariff escalation and negative speculative rhetoric around Chinese ADRs led to capitulation on China specific ETFs last week,” said Malcolm Dorson, senior portfolio manager at Global X Management. “This could continue unless we see the two sides begin to find some common ground.” Trade tensions between the world’s biggest economies have whipsawed global markets and stoked concern over global growth this month. Last week, Beijing retaliated against Trump’s latest tariffs by hiking duties on all US goods to 125 per cent, while calling the administration’s actions a “joke.” The White House set 145 per cent levies on Chinese goods. “If it’s a scenario where the Trump administration maintains very high tariffs on China, it’s clearly negative for China’s growth this year and over the medium term,” said Michael Hirson, head of China Strategy for 22V Research. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. While China said it won’t match any further hikes, it reiterated its vow to “fight to the end” with other, unspecified countermeasures. The impact of this escalting trade war will likely begin to materialise from this month. The escalating trade war and its potential implications on China’s growth is raising questions among investors on which steps will be taken by policymakers to defend the economy. Last week, top leaders from China discussed additional economic stimulus in response to Trump’s tariffs, which could include measures to boost consumer spending, the birth rate and subsidies for some exports. Still, the scale and timing of new stimulus are yet to be finalised, while questions on whether that will be enough to support the Asian nation remain. “Part of the calculation is the need to save policy room for what comes down the road,” Hirson said.

Edward Jones PFS Trade war uncertainty has put stock markets on edge as tariffs have been announced, delayed, implemented, and paused. While we may see lots of short-term market volatility, it may not have a meaningful long-term market impact. Why the optimism? Because the market impact of the 2018-2019 US-China trade war subsided quickly once a resolution was reached. Trade war uncertainty has put stock markets on edge over the past several weeks as the Trump administration has announced, delayed, implemented, and paused tariffs. (In that time, other countries have retaliated with their own tariffs.) As events unfold, it's important to look back at the market response to the tariff wars in the first Trump administration. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it can rhyme — and the 2018-2019 trade war is arguably the best guide we have. The 2018-2019 trade war between the US and China had a significant impact on the US economy. It caused disruptions, price increases (which squeezed some businesses’ profit margins), and elevated uncertainty, which led to stalled US business investment and hiring. Here are just some of the observations from Federal Reserve Beige Books during this period: The 2018-2019 tariff war also had a significant impact on markets, taking them on a roller coaster ride. It led to higher volatility as ups and downs were dictated by news flow on trade talks and the removal of tariffs/application of more tariffs. In general, there was a flight to perceived ‘safe haven’ assets globally. In other words, tariffs caused short-term headwinds. Once markets grew accustomed to them and then a resolution was reached as the Phase I trade deal between the US and China was announced, volatility eased and financial markets reaccelerated. In this episode, we get an economist’s perspective on what tariffs could mean for growth, inflation, and markets. We also talk about what’s driving the recent outperformance of European stocks and the main indicator to watch regarding US inflation.  Brian Levitt: Welcome to Invesco's Greater Possibilities podcast. I'm Brian Levitt, and with me as always is Jodi Phillips. Hey, Jodi. Jodi Phillips: Hey, Brian. So today we're going to be covering quite a few segments once again, including reaching out to our friend Turgut Kışınbay, who's the chief US economist for Invesco Fixed Income. We're going to be asking Turgut for his thoughts on tariffs and their impact on the economy and markets. Brian Levitt: The news flow been fast enough for you, Jodi? Jodi Phillips: I could use a moment or two to process everything, to be honest. Brian Levitt: Just a few? Jodi Phillips: Just a few. I mean, we went straight from the DeepSeek news to some on again, off again, tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and then 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, and then a hotter than expected US inflation report for January. If that wasn't enough in the background, I've been trying to remember my football trivia and markets, whether the markets have done better when the NFC or the AFC wins the championship. Brian Levitt: I always forget that one. What did you learn? Jodi Phillips: Well, the good news is it does better when the NFC teams come out on top. Brian Levitt: Okay. Happy with that. Jodi Phillips: Yeah. Brian Levitt: You sound a little concerned. Is there any bad news there? Jodi Phillips: Well, yeah, there's sort of like a Philadelphia based footnote to that. Yeah, some maybe bad things happen when Philadelphia teams win championships. Brian Levitt: Besides my feelings being hurt? Jodi Phillips: Well, yeah, no, not the optimal outcome for a Giants fan, but I'm talking about the markets. So consider this: in baseball, first of all, the Philadelphia Athletics were the top team in 1929. Brian Levitt: 29, okay. Before the Depression. Jodi Phillips: Yes. And the Phillies won it all in 2008. Brian Levitt: Okay. Global financial crisis, we're doing great here. Jodi Phillips: Right, right. Switching to football, the Eagles won in 2018, and of course this year. So, yeah. Brian Levitt: Good to know. I think I'm going to try to not put too much credence into that. I'll stick to the usual models, rather than the Philadelphia sports teams. Jodi Phillips: Good idea, good idea. Brian Levitt: Good news is 1929 and 2008, years in which the economy was pretty over levered. I'd say that is not the case today. Interesting though. Maybe 2018 makes a little bit more sense. Back then we had concerns about tariffs, even the potential for the Fed to raise rates back then. Jodi Phillips: Raising rates. You don't think that's going to happen, do you? Brian Levitt: No, no. I can't get there. I know some people talk about it. I just can't get there and I think the bar's pretty high for the Fed. Jodi Phillips: I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. And of course on the tariff conversation, as I mentioned, we'll be talking to Turgut in a moment. But before that, let's start with our first topic. Speaker 3: Trending Conversations. Jodi Phillips: Okay, Brian, so what's on everyone's mind? Brian Levitt: You mean besides the success of the Philadelphia teams and the market? Jodi Phillips: Yes, besides that. Besides that. Brian Levitt: So I am going to go with the trending conversation right now is the broadening of the market. Jodi Phillips: So it's happening, this is it? Brian Levitt: It's all happening. Jodi Phillips: Nice. So it's not just a Magnificent Seven this year, then? We're going to get performance from the Unmagnificent 493. Should we call them that? I feel like we need a different name. That's- Brian Levitt: Yeah, I'm sure they'd all be very happy to be called the Unmagnificent. I think it's actually 495. Aren't there 502 companies in the S&P? Jodi Phillips: I'd defer to you. Brian Levitt: Well, whatever, something like that. But yeah, it's more like the parts of the market that hadn't performed in a while have had a very nice start to the year. I'll include mid-cap stocks, value stocks, and this one might surprise you, Jodi, European stocks. So it's MEEGA, Make European Equities Great Again. Jodi Phillips: I'm going to have to track a whole different kind of football trivia if this is the case. So why do you think that is? Why do you think that is? What's going on here? Brian Levitt: I'd say a few things. I'll start with the top down. It's a higher nominal growth environment than we've been in for a long while. Meaning real GDP (gross domestic product) is good in the US, higher inflation, which some people worry about, I think is good. So that adds up to higher nominal growth, and that could benefit value-oriented stocks, smaller capitalization stocks. We always talk about, what can unlock the value, and higher nominal growth can help to do that. Jodi Phillips: All right. So the higher tide lifts more boats, that saying. Brian Levitt: Yeah, and some of it also would be policy-related. We always say, ""Don't fight the Fed."" Well, we don't want to fight the ECB, the Bank of England, and everybody else. So ECB, European Central Bank, is lowering rates, that's providing support to European stocks. We've seen some stimulus out of China. I'd also remind this idea about mid-caps, when the Trump administration came in people were excited about deregulation. Well guess which companies tend to face the highest regulation? Those tend to be mid-cap stocks. And also some optimism around mergers and acquisitions. If we're going to get this wave, that should benefit mid-caps also. Jodi Phillips: Great. So do you think the broader market performance that we're talking about here, can that be sustained? Brian Levitt: Yeah, so that's the optimistic view, but our base case is optimistic. So that's the idea. And investors right now, I think they want to participate, but they feel like perhaps the market's gotten ahead of itself or somewhat overvalued. Well, that's just one part of the market, that's the S&P 500. So it's not about blowing out of those big tech names, but think about the big tech names, and what else can we have in our portfolios. Jodi Phillips: Okay. So for the investors who maybe have grown a little bit tired of waiting for broad market performance, I mean we have kind of heard this before. What's the one thing you would tell them that might make it different this time? Brian Levitt: I would say it's been a long while since we've had a good nominal growth backdrop, but also a Fed that was preparing to gradually lower rates. I mean, think about it, for more than 20 years the Fed has either been raising rates or quickly taking rates to zero to respond to a crisis. So this is different, maybe a slower, gradual easing environment can help unlock some value that exists in parts of the market. Jodi Phillips: Okay. So that can support a broader market, so that's the idea then. Sounds- Brian Levitt: That's the idea. Jodi Phillips: We'll take it. All right, moving on to the next topic. Speaker 3: Phone A Friend. Jodi Phillips: So each episode we're reaching out to a friend of the podcast for a deeper dive on topics that are at the top of investors' minds. Tariffs, no big surprise. We reached out to Turgut Kışınbay, chief US economist at Invesco Fixed income, for his views on tariffs and the potential impact on the economy and markets. And it was a really great wide-ranging conversation, so we're going to bring in a couple different clips on what Turgut had to say. First, we asked him if tariffs are more of an inflation concern or a growth concern. And here's what he said. Turgut Kışınbay: I think tariffs can be both an inflation and a growth concern. So I'm not really worried about the sustained inflation when it comes to tariffs, but it can be a one-off increase in the price level. And the central banks are supposed to see through that, but that's easy to say in theory. But in practice it may not be easy for the Fed to respond, because if the last couple of weeks is an indication, tariffs will be used as a negotiating tool. It can be on and off, that we have tariffs on and then off, and then they're sustained at different countries, different sectors. So for the Fed it'll be a bit difficult to figure which part is transitory, and they have been burned by transitory, and which part is sustained. So I think it is not a sustained inflation risk, but it is still something difficult to manage for the Fed. So, in my view, it can just delay Fed easing cycle a little bit. Jodi Phillips: So then we asked whether the markets have become a little bit too complacent, perhaps, thinking that tariffs might just be a negotiating tool, an on-again off-again thing. So here's his thoughts on that. Turgut Kışınbay: I think the market may be a little complacent on the tariffs. So far I think the market is assuming that this is just going to be a negotiating tool. So just like maybe Colombia is an example that tariffs will be used as a threat, and then a couple of days later it's not implemented. But I think going forward that may not be the case. We'll get into more economic tariffs against autos, against countries with large trade deficits, that US has large trade deficits. Eventually tariffs will come, and I think that that will have an impact on growth, inflation, and even business confidence. Jodi Phillips: And then finally we asked for investors thinking about the type of risk profile they might want in their portfolio, if he thinks tariffs might bring about the end of the business cycle or whether it may create a less optimal outcome for the economy. And here's what he had to say about that. Turgut Kışınbay: I think tariffs create a bit of a more volatile investment environment rather than necessarily like a bearish market. It's just going to be more volatile. I think US economy is quite resilient and tariffs will be again, if they're implemented aggressively, a challenging environment for consumers and maybe some companies who are importing intermediate goods. But I think US economy has proven that it's quite resilient, and I think the policymakers will be sensitive to the economy, and if they see any signs of consumer or business concerns they will basically, maybe not reverse, or go slower, or do something about it. So it's not like I think they will just go ahead blindly and just implement tariffs across the board. But given what we are seeing over the last couple of weeks, that is a more, it is a change. It's a new government. It is a new government that is basically changing the rules of the game compared to the previous decades. So it's a more uncertain environment and there's going to be some volatility. There are going to be winners and losers, but I wouldn't expect an across the board decline in risk assets or a recession in the economy. Jodi Phillips: All right, thank you Turgut for joining us. So our next topic is... Speaker 3: The Inbox Jodi Phillips: So here's where I go to the mail bag, so to speak, and select a question that listeners have had for Brian. You can always reach out to Brian on X or LinkedIn, @BrianLevitt. So, are you ready? Brian Levitt: Yeah, I'm ready. Jodi Phillips: All right, here's the question. What can we watch to determine if inflation is again becoming a problem? Brian Levitt: Price of eggs? Jodi Phillips: Yeah, I just bought some yesterday, so that's top of mind for me. But I thought we strip out food and energy prices when making the determination on inflation. Brian Levitt: Yeah, I think we should. Actually, the price of eggs is a perfect example of that. I'm always asked by people, ""Why do they strip out food and energy? Does the Federal Reserve, do they not drive? Do they not eat?"" They do, I think. They just don't want to be setting policy based on things that are idiosyncratic to the broad inflation picture. So for example, egg prices have risen significantly because of a breakout of avian influenza, bird flu. Jodi Phillips: Bird flu. All right. So that obviously has led to a significant reduction in the egg-laying hen population. But you're saying that's not a reason to raise interest rates? Brian Levitt: No, no, no. Culling the chicken population or the hen population should not be a reason to raise interest rates. Again, that's precisely why they strip out food and energy. It's about broad-based pricing pressure, not these idiosyncratic things. Jodi Phillips: Okay, okay. Then the real answer then, what should investors watch? Brian Levitt: So I'm watching the ten-year US inflation break even, which we may want to define. Jodi Phillips: Sure. All right. The difference in yield between a ten-year Treasury note and a ten-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security. So essentially that's what the market is expecting from inflation, yes? Brian Levitt: Yeah. And the reason we use the long term is because it's going to kind of ignore some of those near-term shocks, like a spike in the price of eggs, or a spike in the price of auto insurance, or some of the things that have been happening. And so what the Federal Reserve wants is price stability, they want to make sure that long-term inflation expectations aren't becoming unmoored. So right now, long-term inflation expectations are sitting at around 2.5%. That seems okay. And if you break out of that, then the Federal Reserve may need to respond to it. That's something to watch. But as of now, it's sitting within what we would all perceive to be a comfort zone. Jodi Phillips: All right. So let's conclude with our last segment where we put Brian on... Speaker 3: The Hot Seat. Jodi Phillips: I'll ask Brian some quick questions and he must answer in as concise a fashion as he can. So, let's go. Are you surprised that market volatility has remained low? Brian Levitt: No, not necessarily. I mean, we talk about policy uncertainty, and market volatility tends to be driven by policy uncertainty. I think the markets right now, at least on the monetary side, feel comfortable with the Fed being on hold. So not a significant amount of uncertainty there. So trade uncertainty remains but the market has been comforted, at least for now, by the president having used the potential tariffs on Canada and Mexico as a starting point, a negotiating tactic, rather than something we were going to follow through with. So yeah, to the extent you get some additional uncertainty around those things, yeah, you could see some market volatility, but I'm not shocked that we haven't seen significant amount now. Jodi Phillips: Great. All right. I think you answered this question a little bit earlier on, but we'll ask again. Why the great start to the year for European stocks? Brian Levitt: Yeah, it's never about good or bad, investors need to remember that sometimes you just get these conditions where things are getting a little bit better. And the bar was set low. Say sentiment is improving as the European Central Bank lowers rates to support growth. And I would add to that, we'll see where these negotiations between Russia and the US over Ukraine go, but it seems to be a little bit of a wake-up call that the Europeans want to increase defense spending, that they may want to issue debt collectively. And so those are things that investors have wanted to see and could help to support growth. Jodi Phillips: Okay. All right. So, next question, we all know how much you like your market milestones. Brian Levitt: I do. Jodi Phillips: We talked last episode about Bitcoin at a hundred thousand, for example. So now, this time, what's your take on gold nearing $3,000 per troy ounce? Brian Levitt: Well, my take is, I've missed the whole thing. But that's okay, because the stock market has done fine as well. You know what's really interesting about gold, it's happened as real yields have risen. So I was always taught that if you can get a positive real yield in Treasuries, why gold? So this is a little bit different. I would say it's being driven by a few things, central bank demand, so particularly from China as they diversify away some from the US dollar. Also, the uncertainty we just talked about with regards to trade. So yeah, gold continues to get a bid. Jodi Phillips: All right, and that brings us to the end of another episode. So Brian, before we go, remind our listeners where they can follow you. Brian Levitt: Yeah. Thanks, Jodi. Visit invesco.com/brianlevitt to read my latest commentaries. I'm being told that I'm being paid by the click now, so help a friend out. I kid, of course. Of course you could follow me on LinkedIn and on X @BrianLevitt. Jodi Phillips: Thanks for joining.

The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. Fluctuations in the price of gold and precious metals may affect the profitability of companies in the gold and precious metals sector. Changes in the political or economic conditions of countries where companies in the gold and precious metals sector are located may have a direct effect on the price of gold and precious metals. Bitcoins are considered a highly speculative investment due to their lack of guaranteed value and limited track record. Because of their digital nature, they pose risks from hackers, malware, fraud, and operational glitches. Bitcoins aren't legal tender and are operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin accounts aren't backed or insured by any type of federal or government program or bank. Bitcoin is a digital currency (also called cryptocurrency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government. Bitcoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept bitcoins as payment. Investments in companies located or operating in Greater China are subject to the following risks: nationalization, expropriation, or confiscation of property, difficulty in obtaining and/or enforcing judgments, alteration or discontinuation of economic reforms, military conflicts, and China’s dependency on the economies of other Asian countries, many of which are developing countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. An issuer may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer’s credit rating. Monetary easing refers to the lowering of interest rates and deposit ratios by central banks. GDP stands for gross domestic product, which is a broad indicator of a region’s economic activity, measuring the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced in that region over a specified period of time. Idiosyncratic developments refer to unique events that do not affect an entire market or portfolio. Inflation is the rate at which the general price level for goods and services is increasing. The Magnificent Seven stocks refer to Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Stocks of medium-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale. Real yields are the returns that a bond investor earns from interest payments after accounting for inflation. A risk asset is generally described as any financial security or instrument that carries risk and is likely to fluctuate in price. Stagflation is an economic condition marked by a combination of slow economic growth and rising prices.

Protectionist measures have tended to result in less optimal economic growth globally in the near term but have not necessarily served as a long-term hurdle for the stock market. So why have markets reacted so negatively knowing recent history? I think because many assumed the Trump administration would be focused on keeping stocks buoyant and would threaten tariffs rather than actually implement them. Also, this time around the tariff war is bigger — it's being fought on multiple fronts simultaneously. However, I think markets will adjust, then experience a hiccup if more tariffs are levied, and so on and so on, like what we saw in the first Trump administration. I expect volatility and downward pressure to continue until greater clarity emerges — which is hopefully sooner rather than later. We also keep getting asked whether the US should be worried about higher inflation or lower growth with tariffs. In the near term, tariffs cause price increases, but they tend to quickly subside as tariffs are removed (which is why I have argued vehemently that when it comes to inflation, we should be far more worried about immigration policy) so they don’t typically result in sustainable inflation. However, tariffs can suppress demand. So I believe growth is a far bigger issue — and it’s the risk we need to worry about if tariffs stay on for a long period of time. Also, retaliation magnifies and globalizes the effects of tariffs, meaning the global economy could end up with less growth and higher inflation. Keep in mind that the US may have less to lose than any one trading partner, but when the war is fought against a range of partners, the cumulative damage on the US economy could be greater than on any one partner. In addition, we have tariff wars going on at the same time that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort is attempting to rapidly and dramatically cut government spending. As I have said before, this could be very negative for the US economy in the near term. We’ll want to keep an eye on signs of any kind of deterioration in sentiment or spending plans resulting from the current environment.

https://www.businessinsider.com/anthony-scaramucci-trump-tariff-trade-policy-economy-recession-europe-china-2025-4,"Anthony Scaramucci Explains Why Trump Tariffs, Trade Policy Will Fail - Business Insider","The future of the global economy may hinge on President Donald Trump's trade policy decisions — and how other countries respond to them. For outspoken Trump critic Anthony Scaramucci, that's chilling. Top business leaders, plus a slew of economists and strategists, have cautioned that Trump's combative tariff policy could lead to costly trade wars. Markets have sold off to price in that risk. And although Trump's protectionist stance on trade may be evolving with his 90-day tariff pause and exemptions on certain tech goods late last week, that's of little comfort to Scaramucci. After all, the president could easily change his mind again, with little to no pushback. ""There's one drum beating in the White House: Donald Trump beats to his own drum,"" Scaramucci told Business Insider in a recent interview. ""There are no other drum beats in the White House. You can fall in line and sing from his chorus sheet, you can fall in line and praise him at a cabinet meeting — or you can get fired. Those are your choices."" Scaramucci is speaking from experience. The founder of SkyBridge Capital worked as Trump's communications director for just 11 days in the first term before getting fired — a fact he often finds amusing. But Scaramucci has little reason to joke around. The so-called ""guardrails"" he thought would keep Trump's impulses in check are missing, in his view, which he sees as no laughing matter. The former White House comms director claimed that Trump tried to revamp US trade policy in his first term — and got shut down. ""What happens is, Trump had six, seven, eight people that were ready to give him 'the Heisman' in 2018 when he tried to pull this — and he got scared,"" Scaramucci said of the trade dispute, referring to the iconic college football trophy featuring a player in a stiff-arm pose. Scaramucci continued: ""He wasn't as confident as he was as president today. Trump term one — a less confident Trump, a more vulnerable Trump. Lots of people in the White House that were garden-variety Republicans, or just common-sense economists — whether it was a Steven Mnuchin or somebody like Gary Cohn — and he extinguished all those people."" The Trump administration's tariff policy outlines several goals, including closing trade deficits and bringing jobs, investment, and manufacturing back to the US. White House spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider: ""Anthony Scaramucci is a fraud and a disgraced clown with no standing to comment on President Trump's historic action to finally address the national emergency posed by our country's chronic trade deficits."" Desai continued: ""President Trump has assembled the best and most experienced trade and economic team in modern history who are working diligently to implement an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy to restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street."" What worries Scaramucci isn't necessarily that Trump is in office, though that wasn't his choice — it's that Republicans aren't challenging the policies that the political pundit says will be harmful. This reminds him of the folktale ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" where no one is willing to speak truth to the leader. ""He's surrounded by sycophants — he's loaded with power,"" Scaramucci said. ""And this goes back to first-grade literature. Sometime in the first grade, you read 'the Emperor has no clothes.' And as a seven-year-old, you were like, 'Well, that's stupid. Why would anybody tell somebody that they have clothes on when there's no clothes?'"" Scaramucci continued: ""And now you're learning in 2025 that there are billionaires and centimillionaires that will stand in the cabinet room and tell somebody that they have clothes on, when they have no clothes."" Shortly after Trump was elected, Scaramucci told Business Insider that he couldn't rule out a 1920s-style stock-market crash — even though he admitted it wasn't his base case. A few months later, the S&P 500 suffered through one of its biggest two-day sell-offs ever as a global trade war became a more realistic risk. Scaramucci said Trump deserves all the blame. ""If Kamala Harris took $14 trillion out of the global stock markets, crushed our relationship with all of our trading partners, alienated us from our allies, what do you think would've happened?"" Scaramucci said. ""Do you Fox News would've said, 'This is 19-D chess, and we're into 17 different dimensional planes of brilliance?'"" Scaramucci suspects that Trump's trade negotiations will be unsuccessful for three key reasons. First, aggressive tariffs could cause a recession — both because they'll cost consumers money, and since other countries will likely retaliate with their own tariffs that weigh on US exports. Tariffs are taxes on imports that buyers bear, so it's no surprise that consumer confidence is spiraling. According to Rosenberg Research, Americans recently said the likelihood of their income increasing in the next year is 35%, the lowest rate since 2011. Just as troubling is that inflation expectations are surging, which could lead to a dreaded stagflation scenario. Those troubles could quickly compound if tariffs escalate and result in a full-blown trade war. That could cripple US businesses, which is the opposite of Trump's stated aim. Also, Scaramucci said the US would be unlikely to win such a dispute after burning its key allies. Nations that were once friendly, including those in Europe, may now turn to rivals like China. ""If you want to start a trade war with me, I'm going to retaliate, and I'm going to up the ante with you,"" Scaramucci said. ""Moreover, I'm going to deal with people that I wouldn't typically deal with."" This leads to what Scaramucci sees as Trump's final miscalculation on trade. The pundit said that the president has not only burdened US consumers and businesses while alienating allies but also underestimated the Chinese Communist Party's pain tolerance. ""The Chinese are very well prepared for this, and Trump doesn't understand their culture,"" Scaramucci said. ""They're not going to want to lose face."" Trump and China's Xi Jinping are both resolute. It may seem like the US has more leverage since China exports far more goods, but it's worth noting that China's authoritarian government has few checks on its power and operates on a plan measured in decades and centuries. By contrast, Trump is term-limited and has less than four years to try to execute his master plan — even if Scaramucci wishes he wouldn't. Jump to",2025-04-15,25
https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/capital-markets-currencies/multibillion-dollar-exodus-hits-china-etfs-amid-trump-tariff-war,Multibillion dollar exodus hits China ETFs amid Trump tariff war - The Business Times,"Search Follow [SAO PAULO] Investors are dumping exchange-traded funds tracking Chinese stocks at a record pace as the world’s biggest economies face off in an escalating trade war that is set to challenge global growth.  Outflows from US-listed emerging market ETFs that invest across developing nations, as well as those that target specific countries, totalled US$5.57 billion in the week ended Apr 11, the most in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of that total, US$3.69 billion came from China. The US$5.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF recorded US$1.2 billion in outflows last week, while the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF saw more than US$1 billion in withdrawals and the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF recorded US$780 million in redemptions. In each case, the outflows were records. Meanwhile, a popular ex-China fund hasn’t seen inflows since September.  “The combination of tariff escalation and negative speculative rhetoric around Chinese ADRs led to capitulation on China specific ETFs last week,” said Malcolm Dorson, senior portfolio manager at Global X Management. “This could continue unless we see the two sides begin to find some common ground.” Trade tensions between the world’s biggest economies have whipsawed global markets and stoked concern over global growth this month. Last week, Beijing retaliated against Trump’s latest tariffs by hiking duties on all US goods to 125 per cent, while calling the administration’s actions a “joke.” The White House set 145 per cent levies on Chinese goods. “If it’s a scenario where the Trump administration maintains very high tariffs on China, it’s clearly negative for China’s growth this year and over the medium term,” said Michael Hirson, head of China Strategy for 22V Research. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. While China said it won’t match any further hikes, it reiterated its vow to “fight to the end” with other, unspecified countermeasures. The impact of this escalting trade war will likely begin to materialise from this month. The escalating trade war and its potential implications on China’s growth is raising questions among investors on which steps will be taken by policymakers to defend the economy. Last week, top leaders from China discussed additional economic stimulus in response to Trump’s tariffs, which could include measures to boost consumer spending, the birth rate and subsidies for some exports. Still, the scale and timing of new stimulus are yet to be finalised, while questions on whether that will be enough to support the Asian nation remain. “Part of the calculation is the need to save policy room for what comes down the road,” Hirson said.

Edward Jones PFS Trade war uncertainty has put stock markets on edge as tariffs have been announced, delayed, implemented, and paused. While we may see lots of short-term market volatility, it may not have a meaningful long-term market impact. Why the optimism? Because the market impact of the 2018-2019 US-China trade war subsided quickly once a resolution was reached. Trade war uncertainty has put stock markets on edge over the past several weeks as the Trump administration has announced, delayed, implemented, and paused tariffs. (In that time, other countries have retaliated with their own tariffs.) As events unfold, it's important to look back at the market response to the tariff wars in the first Trump administration. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it can rhyme — and the 2018-2019 trade war is arguably the best guide we have. The 2018-2019 trade war between the US and China had a significant impact on the US economy. It caused disruptions, price increases (which squeezed some businesses’ profit margins), and elevated uncertainty, which led to stalled US business investment and hiring. Here are just some of the observations from Federal Reserve Beige Books during this period: The 2018-2019 tariff war also had a significant impact on markets, taking them on a roller coaster ride. It led to higher volatility as ups and downs were dictated by news flow on trade talks and the removal of tariffs/application of more tariffs. In general, there was a flight to perceived ‘safe haven’ assets globally. In other words, tariffs caused short-term headwinds. Once markets grew accustomed to them and then a resolution was reached as the Phase I trade deal between the US and China was announced, volatility eased and financial markets reaccelerated. In this episode, we get an economist’s perspective on what tariffs could mean for growth, inflation, and markets. We also talk about what’s driving the recent outperformance of European stocks and the main indicator to watch regarding US inflation.  Brian Levitt: Welcome to Invesco's Greater Possibilities podcast. I'm Brian Levitt, and with me as always is Jodi Phillips. Hey, Jodi. Jodi Phillips: Hey, Brian. So today we're going to be covering quite a few segments once again, including reaching out to our friend Turgut Kışınbay, who's the chief US economist for Invesco Fixed Income. We're going to be asking Turgut for his thoughts on tariffs and their impact on the economy and markets. Brian Levitt: The news flow been fast enough for you, Jodi? Jodi Phillips: I could use a moment or two to process everything, to be honest. Brian Levitt: Just a few? Jodi Phillips: Just a few. I mean, we went straight from the DeepSeek news to some on again, off again, tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and then 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, and then a hotter than expected US inflation report for January. If that wasn't enough in the background, I've been trying to remember my football trivia and markets, whether the markets have done better when the NFC or the AFC wins the championship. Brian Levitt: I always forget that one. What did you learn? Jodi Phillips: Well, the good news is it does better when the NFC teams come out on top. Brian Levitt: Okay. Happy with that. Jodi Phillips: Yeah. Brian Levitt: You sound a little concerned. Is there any bad news there? Jodi Phillips: Well, yeah, there's sort of like a Philadelphia based footnote to that. Yeah, some maybe bad things happen when Philadelphia teams win championships. Brian Levitt: Besides my feelings being hurt? Jodi Phillips: Well, yeah, no, not the optimal outcome for a Giants fan, but I'm talking about the markets. So consider this: in baseball, first of all, the Philadelphia Athletics were the top team in 1929. Brian Levitt: 29, okay. Before the Depression. Jodi Phillips: Yes. And the Phillies won it all in 2008. Brian Levitt: Okay. Global financial crisis, we're doing great here. Jodi Phillips: Right, right. Switching to football, the Eagles won in 2018, and of course this year. So, yeah. Brian Levitt: Good to know. I think I'm going to try to not put too much credence into that. I'll stick to the usual models, rather than the Philadelphia sports teams. Jodi Phillips: Good idea, good idea. Brian Levitt: Good news is 1929 and 2008, years in which the economy was pretty over levered. I'd say that is not the case today. Interesting though. Maybe 2018 makes a little bit more sense. Back then we had concerns about tariffs, even the potential for the Fed to raise rates back then. Jodi Phillips: Raising rates. You don't think that's going to happen, do you? Brian Levitt: No, no. I can't get there. I know some people talk about it. I just can't get there and I think the bar's pretty high for the Fed. Jodi Phillips: I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. And of course on the tariff conversation, as I mentioned, we'll be talking to Turgut in a moment. But before that, let's start with our first topic. Speaker 3: Trending Conversations. Jodi Phillips: Okay, Brian, so what's on everyone's mind? Brian Levitt: You mean besides the success of the Philadelphia teams and the market? Jodi Phillips: Yes, besides that. Besides that. Brian Levitt: So I am going to go with the trending conversation right now is the broadening of the market. Jodi Phillips: So it's happening, this is it? Brian Levitt: It's all happening. Jodi Phillips: Nice. So it's not just a Magnificent Seven this year, then? We're going to get performance from the Unmagnificent 493. Should we call them that? I feel like we need a different name. That's- Brian Levitt: Yeah, I'm sure they'd all be very happy to be called the Unmagnificent. I think it's actually 495. Aren't there 502 companies in the S&P? Jodi Phillips: I'd defer to you. Brian Levitt: Well, whatever, something like that. But yeah, it's more like the parts of the market that hadn't performed in a while have had a very nice start to the year. I'll include mid-cap stocks, value stocks, and this one might surprise you, Jodi, European stocks. So it's MEEGA, Make European Equities Great Again. Jodi Phillips: I'm going to have to track a whole different kind of football trivia if this is the case. So why do you think that is? Why do you think that is? What's going on here? Brian Levitt: I'd say a few things. I'll start with the top down. It's a higher nominal growth environment than we've been in for a long while. Meaning real GDP (gross domestic product) is good in the US, higher inflation, which some people worry about, I think is good. So that adds up to higher nominal growth, and that could benefit value-oriented stocks, smaller capitalization stocks. We always talk about, what can unlock the value, and higher nominal growth can help to do that. Jodi Phillips: All right. So the higher tide lifts more boats, that saying. Brian Levitt: Yeah, and some of it also would be policy-related. We always say, ""Don't fight the Fed."" Well, we don't want to fight the ECB, the Bank of England, and everybody else. So ECB, European Central Bank, is lowering rates, that's providing support to European stocks. We've seen some stimulus out of China. I'd also remind this idea about mid-caps, when the Trump administration came in people were excited about deregulation. Well guess which companies tend to face the highest regulation? Those tend to be mid-cap stocks. And also some optimism around mergers and acquisitions. If we're going to get this wave, that should benefit mid-caps also. Jodi Phillips: Great. So do you think the broader market performance that we're talking about here, can that be sustained? Brian Levitt: Yeah, so that's the optimistic view, but our base case is optimistic. So that's the idea. And investors right now, I think they want to participate, but they feel like perhaps the market's gotten ahead of itself or somewhat overvalued. Well, that's just one part of the market, that's the S&P 500. So it's not about blowing out of those big tech names, but think about the big tech names, and what else can we have in our portfolios. Jodi Phillips: Okay. So for the investors who maybe have grown a little bit tired of waiting for broad market performance, I mean we have kind of heard this before. What's the one thing you would tell them that might make it different this time? Brian Levitt: I would say it's been a long while since we've had a good nominal growth backdrop, but also a Fed that was preparing to gradually lower rates. I mean, think about it, for more than 20 years the Fed has either been raising rates or quickly taking rates to zero to respond to a crisis. So this is different, maybe a slower, gradual easing environment can help unlock some value that exists in parts of the market. Jodi Phillips: Okay. So that can support a broader market, so that's the idea then. Sounds- Brian Levitt: That's the idea. Jodi Phillips: We'll take it. All right, moving on to the next topic. Speaker 3: Phone A Friend. Jodi Phillips: So each episode we're reaching out to a friend of the podcast for a deeper dive on topics that are at the top of investors' minds. Tariffs, no big surprise. We reached out to Turgut Kışınbay, chief US economist at Invesco Fixed income, for his views on tariffs and the potential impact on the economy and markets. And it was a really great wide-ranging conversation, so we're going to bring in a couple different clips on what Turgut had to say. First, we asked him if tariffs are more of an inflation concern or a growth concern. And here's what he said. Turgut Kışınbay: I think tariffs can be both an inflation and a growth concern. So I'm not really worried about the sustained inflation when it comes to tariffs, but it can be a one-off increase in the price level. And the central banks are supposed to see through that, but that's easy to say in theory. But in practice it may not be easy for the Fed to respond, because if the last couple of weeks is an indication, tariffs will be used as a negotiating tool. It can be on and off, that we have tariffs on and then off, and then they're sustained at different countries, different sectors. So for the Fed it'll be a bit difficult to figure which part is transitory, and they have been burned by transitory, and which part is sustained. So I think it is not a sustained inflation risk, but it is still something difficult to manage for the Fed. So, in my view, it can just delay Fed easing cycle a little bit. Jodi Phillips: So then we asked whether the markets have become a little bit too complacent, perhaps, thinking that tariffs might just be a negotiating tool, an on-again off-again thing. So here's his thoughts on that. Turgut Kışınbay: I think the market may be a little complacent on the tariffs. So far I think the market is assuming that this is just going to be a negotiating tool. So just like maybe Colombia is an example that tariffs will be used as a threat, and then a couple of days later it's not implemented. But I think going forward that may not be the case. We'll get into more economic tariffs against autos, against countries with large trade deficits, that US has large trade deficits. Eventually tariffs will come, and I think that that will have an impact on growth, inflation, and even business confidence. Jodi Phillips: And then finally we asked for investors thinking about the type of risk profile they might want in their portfolio, if he thinks tariffs might bring about the end of the business cycle or whether it may create a less optimal outcome for the economy. And here's what he had to say about that. Turgut Kışınbay: I think tariffs create a bit of a more volatile investment environment rather than necessarily like a bearish market. It's just going to be more volatile. I think US economy is quite resilient and tariffs will be again, if they're implemented aggressively, a challenging environment for consumers and maybe some companies who are importing intermediate goods. But I think US economy has proven that it's quite resilient, and I think the policymakers will be sensitive to the economy, and if they see any signs of consumer or business concerns they will basically, maybe not reverse, or go slower, or do something about it. So it's not like I think they will just go ahead blindly and just implement tariffs across the board. But given what we are seeing over the last couple of weeks, that is a more, it is a change. It's a new government. It is a new government that is basically changing the rules of the game compared to the previous decades. So it's a more uncertain environment and there's going to be some volatility. There are going to be winners and losers, but I wouldn't expect an across the board decline in risk assets or a recession in the economy. Jodi Phillips: All right, thank you Turgut for joining us. So our next topic is... Speaker 3: The Inbox Jodi Phillips: So here's where I go to the mail bag, so to speak, and select a question that listeners have had for Brian. You can always reach out to Brian on X or LinkedIn, @BrianLevitt. So, are you ready? Brian Levitt: Yeah, I'm ready. Jodi Phillips: All right, here's the question. What can we watch to determine if inflation is again becoming a problem? Brian Levitt: Price of eggs? Jodi Phillips: Yeah, I just bought some yesterday, so that's top of mind for me. But I thought we strip out food and energy prices when making the determination on inflation. Brian Levitt: Yeah, I think we should. Actually, the price of eggs is a perfect example of that. I'm always asked by people, ""Why do they strip out food and energy? Does the Federal Reserve, do they not drive? Do they not eat?"" They do, I think. They just don't want to be setting policy based on things that are idiosyncratic to the broad inflation picture. So for example, egg prices have risen significantly because of a breakout of avian influenza, bird flu. Jodi Phillips: Bird flu. All right. So that obviously has led to a significant reduction in the egg-laying hen population. But you're saying that's not a reason to raise interest rates? Brian Levitt: No, no, no. Culling the chicken population or the hen population should not be a reason to raise interest rates. Again, that's precisely why they strip out food and energy. It's about broad-based pricing pressure, not these idiosyncratic things. Jodi Phillips: Okay, okay. Then the real answer then, what should investors watch? Brian Levitt: So I'm watching the ten-year US inflation break even, which we may want to define. Jodi Phillips: Sure. All right. The difference in yield between a ten-year Treasury note and a ten-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security. So essentially that's what the market is expecting from inflation, yes? Brian Levitt: Yeah. And the reason we use the long term is because it's going to kind of ignore some of those near-term shocks, like a spike in the price of eggs, or a spike in the price of auto insurance, or some of the things that have been happening. And so what the Federal Reserve wants is price stability, they want to make sure that long-term inflation expectations aren't becoming unmoored. So right now, long-term inflation expectations are sitting at around 2.5%. That seems okay. And if you break out of that, then the Federal Reserve may need to respond to it. That's something to watch. But as of now, it's sitting within what we would all perceive to be a comfort zone. Jodi Phillips: All right. So let's conclude with our last segment where we put Brian on... Speaker 3: The Hot Seat. Jodi Phillips: I'll ask Brian some quick questions and he must answer in as concise a fashion as he can. So, let's go. Are you surprised that market volatility has remained low? Brian Levitt: No, not necessarily. I mean, we talk about policy uncertainty, and market volatility tends to be driven by policy uncertainty. I think the markets right now, at least on the monetary side, feel comfortable with the Fed being on hold. So not a significant amount of uncertainty there. So trade uncertainty remains but the market has been comforted, at least for now, by the president having used the potential tariffs on Canada and Mexico as a starting point, a negotiating tactic, rather than something we were going to follow through with. So yeah, to the extent you get some additional uncertainty around those things, yeah, you could see some market volatility, but I'm not shocked that we haven't seen significant amount now. Jodi Phillips: Great. All right. I think you answered this question a little bit earlier on, but we'll ask again. Why the great start to the year for European stocks? Brian Levitt: Yeah, it's never about good or bad, investors need to remember that sometimes you just get these conditions where things are getting a little bit better. And the bar was set low. Say sentiment is improving as the European Central Bank lowers rates to support growth. And I would add to that, we'll see where these negotiations between Russia and the US over Ukraine go, but it seems to be a little bit of a wake-up call that the Europeans want to increase defense spending, that they may want to issue debt collectively. And so those are things that investors have wanted to see and could help to support growth. Jodi Phillips: Okay. All right. So, next question, we all know how much you like your market milestones. Brian Levitt: I do. Jodi Phillips: We talked last episode about Bitcoin at a hundred thousand, for example. So now, this time, what's your take on gold nearing $3,000 per troy ounce? Brian Levitt: Well, my take is, I've missed the whole thing. But that's okay, because the stock market has done fine as well. You know what's really interesting about gold, it's happened as real yields have risen. So I was always taught that if you can get a positive real yield in Treasuries, why gold? So this is a little bit different. I would say it's being driven by a few things, central bank demand, so particularly from China as they diversify away some from the US dollar. Also, the uncertainty we just talked about with regards to trade. So yeah, gold continues to get a bid. Jodi Phillips: All right, and that brings us to the end of another episode. So Brian, before we go, remind our listeners where they can follow you. Brian Levitt: Yeah. Thanks, Jodi. Visit invesco.com/brianlevitt to read my latest commentaries.

In general, stock values fluctuate, sometimes widely, in response to activities specific to the company as well as general market, economic and political conditions. Stocks of small- and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale. A value style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns will trail other styles of investing or the overall stock markets. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. Fluctuations in the price of gold and precious metals may affect the profitability of companies in the gold and precious metals sector. Changes in the political or economic conditions of countries where companies in the gold and precious metals sector are located may have a direct effect on the price of gold and precious metals. Bitcoins are considered a highly speculative investment due to their lack of guaranteed value and limited track record. Because of their digital nature, they pose risks from hackers, malware, fraud, and operational glitches. Bitcoins aren't legal tender and are operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies. Bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin accounts aren't backed or insured by any type of federal or government program or bank. Bitcoin is a digital currency (also called cryptocurrency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government. Bitcoins can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept bitcoins as payment. Investments in companies located or operating in Greater China are subject to the following risks: nationalization, expropriation, or confiscation of property, difficulty in obtaining and/or enforcing judgments, alteration or discontinuation of economic reforms, military conflicts, and China’s dependency on the economies of other Asian countries, many of which are developing countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit risk of the issuer and the effects of changing interest rates. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. An issuer may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer’s credit rating. Monetary easing refers to the lowering of interest rates and deposit ratios by central banks. GDP stands for gross domestic product, which is a broad indicator of a region’s economic activity, measuring the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced in that region over a specified period of time. Idiosyncratic developments refer to unique events that do not affect an entire market or portfolio. Inflation is the rate at which the general price level for goods and services is increasing. The Magnificent Seven stocks refer to Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Stocks of medium-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale. Real yields are the returns that a bond investor earns from interest payments after accounting for inflation. A risk asset is generally described as any financial security or instrument that carries risk and is likely to fluctuate in price.

Protectionist measures have tended to result in less optimal economic growth globally in the near term but have not necessarily served as a long-term hurdle for the stock market. So why have markets reacted so negatively knowing recent history? I think because many assumed the Trump administration would be focused on keeping stocks buoyant and would threaten tariffs rather than actually implement them. Also, this time around the tariff war is bigger — it's being fought on multiple fronts simultaneously. However, I think markets will adjust, then experience a hiccup if more tariffs are levied, and so on and so on, like what we saw in the first Trump administration. I expect volatility and downward pressure to continue until greater clarity emerges — which is hopefully sooner rather than later. We also keep getting asked whether the US should be worried about higher inflation or lower growth with tariffs. In the near term, tariffs cause price increases, but they tend to quickly subside as tariffs are removed (which is why I have argued vehemently that when it comes to inflation, we should be far more worried about immigration policy) so they don’t typically result in sustainable inflation. However, tariffs can suppress demand. So I believe growth is a far bigger issue — and it’s the risk we need to worry about if tariffs stay on for a long period of time. Also, retaliation magnifies and globalizes the effects of tariffs, meaning the global economy could end up with less growth and higher inflation. Keep in mind that the US may have less to lose than any one trading partner, but when the war is fought against a range of partners, the cumulative damage on the US economy could be greater than on any one partner. In addition, we have tariff wars going on at the same time that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort is attempting to rapidly and dramatically cut government spending. As I have said before, this could be very negative for the US economy in the near term. We’ll want to keep an eye on signs of any kind of deterioration in sentiment or spending plans resulting from the current environment.
