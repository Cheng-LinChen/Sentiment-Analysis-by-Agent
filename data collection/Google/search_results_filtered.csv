 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC or Taiwan Semiconductor)[5][6] is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the world's most valuable semiconductor company,[7] the world's largest dedicated independent (""pure-play"") semiconductor foundry,[8] and Taiwan's largest company,[9][10] with headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Although the central government of Taiwan is the largest individual shareholder,[11] the majority of TSMC is owned by foreign investors.[12] In 2023, the company was ranked 44th in the Forbes Global 2000.[13] Taiwan's exports of integrated circuits amounted to $184 billion in 2022, accounted for nearly 25 percent of Taiwan's GDP. TSMC constitutes about 30 percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main index.[14][15]
 TSMC was founded in Taiwan in 1987 by Morris Chang as the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry. It has long been the leading company in its field.[16][17] When Chang retired in 2018, after 31 years of TSMC leadership, Mark Liu became chairman and C. C. Wei became Chief Executive.[18][19] It has been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange since 1993; in 1997 it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 1994, TSMC has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4 percent in revenue and a CAGR of 16.1 percent in earnings.[20]
 Most fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC.[21] Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services.[22] Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC.[23][24] At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP portfolio.[dubious – discuss]
 TSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.
 In 1986, Li Kwoh-ting, representing the Executive Yuan, invited Morris Chang to serve as the president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and offered him a blank check to build Taiwan's chip industry. At that time, the Taiwanese government wanted to develop its semiconductor industry, but its high investment and high risk nature made it difficult to find investors. Texas Instruments and Intel turned down Chang. Only Philips was willing to sign a joint venture contract with Taiwan to put up $58 million, transfer its production technology, and license intellectual property in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in TSMC. Alongside generous tax benefits, the Taiwanese government, through the National Development Fund, Executive Yuan, provided another 48 percent of the startup capital for TSMC, and the rest of the capital was raised from several of the island's wealthiest families, who owned firms that specialized in plastics, textiles, and chemicals. These wealthy Taiwanese were directly ""asked"" by the government to invest. From day one, TSMC was not really a private business: it was a project of the Taiwanese state.[25][26][27] Its first CEO was James E. Dykes, who left after a year and Morris Chang became the CEO.[28]
 Since then, the company has continued to grow, albeit subject to the cycles of demand. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39 percent to NT$50 billion to fend off growing competition.[29] The company also planned to expand capacity by 30 percent in 2011 to meet strong market demand.[30] In May 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to increase and improve manufacturing capabilities after the company forecast higher than expected demand.[31] In August 2014, TSMC's board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.[32]
 In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple's iPad and iPhone devices.[33][34] According to reports,[35] in May 2014 Apple sourced its A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC.[36][37] Apple then sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung (to increase volume for iPhone 6S launch) and the A9X exclusively with TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. As of 2014, Apple was TSMC's most important customer.[37][38] In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.[39]
 Over the objection of the Tsai Ing-wen administration, in March 2017, TSMC invested US$3 billion in Nanjing to develop a manufacturing subsidiary there.[40]: 74 
 In 2020, TSMC became the first semiconductor company in the world to sign up for the RE100 initiative, pledging to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2050.[41] TSMC accounts for roughly 5 percent of the energy consumption in Taiwan, even exceeding that of the capital city Taipei. This initiative was thus expected to accelerate the transformation to renewable energy in the country.[42] For 2020, TSMC had a net income of US$17.60 billion on a consolidated revenue of US$45.51 billion, an increase of 57.5 percent and 31.4 percent respectively from the 2019 level of US$11.18 billion net income and US$34.63 billion consolidated revenue.[43] Its market capitalization  was over $550 billion in April 2021. TSMC's revenue in the first quarter of 2020 reached US$10 billion,[44] while its market capitalization was US$254 billion.[45] TSMC's market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010.[46] It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world's most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion,[47] while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014.[45] In March 2017, TSMC's market capitalization surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel's at US$165.7 billion.[48] On 27 June 2020, TSMC briefly became the world's 10th most valuable company, with a market capitalization of US$410 billion.[49]
 To mitigate business risks in the event of war between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, since the beginning of the 2020s, TSMC has expanded its geographic operations, opening new fabs in Japan and the United States, with further plans for expansion into Germany.[50] In July 2020, TSMC confirmed it would halt the shipment of silicon wafers to Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei and its subsidiary HiSilicon by 14 September.[51][52] In November 2020, officials in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States approved TSMC's plan to build a $12 billion chip plant in the city. The decision to locate a plant in the US came after the Trump administration warned about the issues concerning the world's electronics made outside of the U.S.[53] In 2021, news reports claimed that the facility might be tripled to roughly a $35 billion investment with six factories.[54] See TSMC § Arizona for more details.
 In June 2021, following nearly a year of public controversy surrounding its COVID-19 vaccine shortage,[55][56][57][58] with only about 10 percent of its 23.5 million population vaccinated;[55] Taiwan agreed to allow TSMC and Foxconn to jointly negotiate purchasing COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf.[57][55] In July 2021, BioNTech's Chinese sales agent Fosun Pharma announced that the two technology manufacturers had reached an agreement to purchase 10 million BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines from Germany.[57][55] TSMC and Foxconn pledged to each buy five million doses for up to $175 million,[57] for donation to Taiwan's vaccination program.[55]
 Due to the 2020–2023 global semiconductor shortage, Taiwanese competitor United Microelectronics raised prices approximately 7–9 percent, and prices for TSMC's more mature processors were raised by about 20 percent.[59] In November 2021, TSMC and Sony announced that TSMC would be establishing a new subsidiary named Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) in Kumamoto, Japan. The subsidiary manufactures 22- and 28-nanometer processes. The initial investment was approximately $7 billion, with Sony investing approximately $500 million for a less than 20 percent stake. Construction of the fabrication plant started in 2022, with production beginning two years later in 2024.[60]
 In February 2022, TSMC, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, and Denso announced that Denso would take a more than 10 percent equity stake in JASM with a US$0.35 billion investment, amid a scarcity of chips for automobiles.[61][62][63] TSMC will also enhance JASM's capabilities with 12/16 nanometer FinFET process technology in addition to the previously announced 22/28 nanometer process and increase monthly production capacity from 45,000 to 55,000 12-inch wafers.[61][62][63] The total capital expenditure for JASM's Kumamoto fab is estimated to be approximately US$8.6 billion.[61][62][63] The Japanese government wants JASM to supply essential chips to Japan's electronic device makers and auto companies as trade friction between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains.[61][62][63] The fab is expected to directly create about 1,700 high-tech professional jobs.[61][62]
 In July 2022, TSMC announced the company had posted a record profit in the second quarter, with net income up 76.4 percent year-over-year. The company saw steady growth in the automotive and data center sectors with some weakness in the consumer market. Some of the capital expenditures are projected to be pushed up to 2023.[64] In the third quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed purchase of 60 million shares in TSMC, acquiring a $4.1 billion stake, making it one of its largest holdings in a technology company.[65] However, Berkshire sold off 86.2 percent of its stake by the next quarter citing geopolitical tensions as a factor.[66][67] In February 2024, TSMC shares hit a record high, with the high on the trading day reaching NT$709 and closing at NT$697 (+8%). This was influenced by the increase in the price target on chip designer Nvidia. TSMC currently manufactures 3-nanometer chips and plans to start 2-nanometer mass production in 2025.[68] It is included in the FTSE4Good Index, being the only Asian company in the top ten.[69]
 In October 2024, TSMC informed the United States Department of Commerce about a potential breach of export controls in which one of its most advanced chips was sent to Huawei via another company with ties to the Chinese government.[70][71][72]
 On 26 August 2019, GlobalFoundries filed several patent infringement lawsuits against TSMC in the US and Germany claiming that TSMC's 7 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm, 16 nm, and 28 nm nodes infringed 16 of their patents.[73] GlobalFoundries named twenty defendants.[74] TSMC said that they were confident that the allegations were baseless.[75] On 1 October 2019, TSMC filed patent infringement lawsuits against GlobalFoundries in the US, Germany and Singapore, claiming that GlobalFoundries' 12 nm, 14 nm, 22 nm, 28 nm and 40 nm nodes infringed 25 of their patents.[76] On 29 October 2019, TSMC and GlobalFoundries announced a resolution to the dispute, agreeing to a life-of-patents cross-license for all of their existing semiconductor patents and new patents for the next 10 years.[77][78][79][80][81]
 The key trends for TSMC are (as of the financial year ending December 31):[83][84][85]
 TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the cyclical industrial dynamics of the semiconductor industry. TSMC must ensure its production capacity to meet strong customer demand during upturns; however, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weak demand and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities.[87] As a result, the company's financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC's business has generally also been seasonal, with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.
 In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications,[88][89] leading major smartphone chip companies, such as Qualcomm,[90][91] Mediatek,[91][92] and Apple,[36][38] to place an increasing amount of orders.[88] While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity,[92] the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.[89]
 For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted 'unseasonably strong' first-quarter results.[31][93] For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nm technology business growing more than 30 percent from the previous quarter.[94] Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules,[95] and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.[96]
 However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10 percent in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers.[97] TSMC's revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28 percent over the previous year, while TSMC forecasted that revenue for 2015 would grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 200mm fabs.[97]
 In 2019, TSMC was ranked fourth in the MEMS field, behind leader Silex Microsystems.[98] In 2021, TSMC was ranked third in the MEMS field.[99]
 Around 56 percent of TSMC shares are held by the general public and around 38 percent are held by institutions. The largest shareholders in early 2024 were:[100]
 TSMC's N7+ is the first commercially available extreme-ultraviolet lithographic process in the semiconductor industry.[101] It uses ultraviolet patterning and enables more acute circuits to be implemented on the silicon. N7+ offers a 15–20 percent higher transistor density and 10 percent reduction in power consumption than previous technology.[102][103] The N7 achieved the fastest ever volume time to market, faster than 10 nm and 16 nm.[104] The N5 iteration doubles transistor density and improves performance by an additional 15 percent.[105][106]
 On 300 mm wafers, TSMC has silicon lithography on node sizes:
 It also offers ""design for manufacturing"" (DFM) customer services.[117] In press publications, these processes will often be referenced, for example, for the mobile variant, simply by 7nmFinFET or even more briefly by 7FF. At the beginning of 2019, TSMC was advertising N7+, N7, and N6 as its leading edge technologies.[115] As of June 2020, TSMC is the manufacturer selected for production of Apple's 5 nanometer ARM processors, as ""the company plans to eventually transition the entire Mac lineup to its Arm-based processors, including the priciest desktop computers"".[118] In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan's west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world's largest corporate green energy order ever made.[119] In July 2021, both Apple and Intel were reported to be testing their proprietary chip designs with TSMC's 3 nm production.[120]

 The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010.[121] The facility was expected to manufacture over 100,000 wafers a month and generate US$5 billion per year of revenue.[122] TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15.[123] On 12 January 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300mm fabs (Fab 12B) to cope with increasing global demand.[124]
 In 2020, TSMC announced a planned fab in Phoenix, Arizona, intended to begin production by 2024 at a rate of 20,000 wafers per month. As of 2020, TSMC announced that it would bring its newest 5 nm process to the Arizona facility, a significant break from its prior practice of limiting US fabs to older technologies. The Arizona plant was estimated to not be fully operational until 2024, when the 5 nm process is projected to be replaced by TSMC's 3 nm process as the latest technology.[125] At launch it will be the most advanced fab in the United States.[126] TSMC plans to spend $12 billion on the project over eight years, beginning in 2021.[125] TSMC claimed the plant will create 1,900 full-time jobs.[127]
 In December 2022, TSMC announced its plans to triple its investment in the Arizona plants in response to the growing tensions between the US and China and the supply chain disruption that has led to chip shortages.[128] In that same month, TSMC stated that they were running into major cost issues, because the cost of construction of buildings and facilities in the US is four to five times what an identical plant would cost in Taiwan, (due to higher costs of labor, red tape, and training), as well as difficulty finding qualified personnel (for which it has hired US workers and sent them for training in Taiwan for 12–18 months.) These additional production costs will increase the cost of TSMC's chips made in the US to at least 50 percent more than the cost of chips made in Taiwan.[129][130][131] In July 2023 TSMC warned that US talent was insufficient, so Taiwanese workers will need to be brought in for a limited time, and that the chip factory will not be operational until 2025.[132] In September 2023, an analyst said the chips will still need to be sent back to Taiwan for packaging.[133] In January 2024, TSMC chairman Liu again warned that Arizona lacked workers with the specialized skills to hire and that TSMC's second Arizona plant likely will not start volume production of advanced chips until 2027 or 2028.[134]
 In April 2024, the US Commerce Department agreed to provide $6.6 billion in direct funding and up to $5 billion in loans to TSMC for the purposes of creating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Arizona. This action falls under the CHIPS and Science Act and is intended to boost domestic chip production for the US.[135]
 In October 2024 it was revealed that development around the TSMC plants would be called Halo Vista, that will develop 3,500 acres of property from restaurants, hotels, housing, and other Mixed-use development.  There will also be a Sonoran Oasis Research and Technology Park that will also help set up the supply chain and foster innovative development, much like how Hsinchu Science Park is to TSMC in Taiwan. As many as 6 fabrication plants could be built there worth a total of around $120 billion.[136]
 TSMC Washington is a subsidiary of TSMC based in Camas, Washington, 32 km (20 mi) outside Portland, Oregon. The 105 ha (260 acres) campus contains a 9.3 ha (23 acres) complex consisting of a 12,000 m2 (130,000 sq ft) 200mm wafer fabrication plant.[137] TSMC Washington (originally known as WaferTech) was established in June 1996 as a joint venture between TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI. The companies along with minor individual investors placed US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The facility started production in July 1998 with its first product being a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera.[citation needed] TSMC bought out the stake of the other partners in 2000, turning the company into a fully-owned subsidiary of TSMC.[138] As of 2024, the facility employs 1100 workers and supports node sizes of 0.35, 0.30, 0.25, 0.22, 0.18, and 0.16 micrometers, with an emphasis on embedded flash process technology.[139]
 In November 2021, TSMC and Sony announced that TSMC would be establishing a new subsidiary named Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) in Kumamoto, Japan. Denso and Toyota have also invested in the company and are minor shareholders.[140]
 The first factory (Fab 23) in Kikuyo, Kumamoto, began commercial operations in December 2024 and produces 12-, 22-, and 28-nanometer processes. Fab 23 cost US$8.6 billion to build, with 476 billion yen subsidised by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).[141]
 The second factory, currently under construction adjacent to Fab 23 as of January 2025, will produce 6-nanometer and 12-nanometer processes. This factory is estimated to cost US$13.9 billion, with 732 billion yen funded by the METI.[141]
 In August 2023, TSMC committed €3.5 billion to a €10+ billion factory in Dresden, Germany. The plant is subsidised with €5 billion from the German government. Three European companies (Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies, and NXP Semiconductors) invested in the plant in return for a 10 percent share each. The resulting joint venture with TSMC is named European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC).[142][143][144][145] The factory is planned to be fully operational in 2029 with a monthly capacity of 40,000 12-inch wafers.[146]

All Rights Reserved. This photo shows the logo of TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) during the Taiwan Innotech Expo at the World Trade Center in Taipei, Taiwan, Oct. 14, 2022. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying, File) TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s president and top chipmaker TSMC held a joint news conference Thursday to defend the company’s decision to invest $100 billion in the U.S., saying it stemmed from customer demand and not pressure from the Trump administration. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, said earlier this week it would invest $100 billion in three more chip manufacturing plants, along with two packaging facilities in Arizona.  The decision sparked concerns that Taiwan would gain little in return for moving some of its most advanced manufacturing processes to the U.S. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te denied that TSMC’s investment decision was due to political pressure by the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump had previously said that Taiwan had taken away the U.S. chip business and that he wanted it back. “TSMC’s decision is necessary for its future development. The government did not face pressure from the United States during TSMC’s investment process in the U.S.,” said Lai on Thursday. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said that he had spoken with the firm’s customers and realized that TSMC’s current expansion plans in the U.S. were insufficient to meet current demand. “Customer demand has been steadily increasing. For TSMC, our investment plans are based on customer needs, and we are very cautious,” Wei said. “The amount of investment in the U.S. may seem large, but it is still not enough to meet demand,” he added. 
 He also said that the development plans in the U.S. would not affect TSMC’s plans in Taiwan, and that the company currently had 10,000 employees researching and developing 1.0 nanometer chips. While Taiwan is a self-ruled island, Beijing sees Taiwan as a renegade province to be taken back by force if necessary. The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.  But the continued support of the U.S. appears increasingly fragile under the Trump administration, who has contended that Taiwan relies too much on the U.S. and needs to spend more on defense. A Pentagon nominee earlier this week said Taiwan should be spending about 10% of its gross domestic product on defense to deter a war with China. Taiwan’s Lai last month pledged to increase defense spending to over 3% of its gross domestic product, up from less than 2.5%.

 Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te and C.C Wei, Chairman and CEO of TSMC hold press conference at Taiwan presidential office in Taipei, Taiwan on Mar 6, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Ann Wang) TAIPEI: Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC's plan to invest US$100 billion in the United States was a ""historic moment"" for Taiwan-US ties, the island's President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday (Mar 6). TSMC, which counts Apple and Nvidia among its clients, announced the plan this week after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on overseas-made chips. It will take the total amount the world's biggest chipmaker has pledged to invest in the United States to US$165 billion, which TSMC said was the ""largest single foreign direct investment in US history"". Lai hailed the ""historic moment for Taiwan-US relations"" at a joint news conference with TSMC chairman and chief executive C.C. Wei at the Presidential Office. It followed Trump's accusations that Taiwan stole the US chip industry and his threats to impose tariffs of up to 100 per cent, as well as Taipei's promises to invest more in the US. TSMC has long faced demands to move more of its production away from Taiwan, with fears that supplies of the critical technology could be disrupted in any conflict with Beijing. China has upped military pressure on Taiwan in recent years to press its claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled island, where TSMC has its headquarters and the bulk of its fabrication plants. Trump recently ratcheted up the pressure on TSMC and other chip manufacturers by publicly mulling the introduction of 25 per cent, or higher, tariffs on all chips made outside the US. Lai said on Thursday the government was not pressured by Washington ""during TSMC's US investment process"". Wei said TSMC's expansion was driven by growing demand from US clients and it would not affect the company's investments in Taiwan. TSMC planned to build 11 new production lines in Taiwan this year to meet demand, Wei said, adding ""our production capacity is not enough"". ""Whenever TSMC builds a production line in any location outside Taiwan, it is always driven by customer demand,"" Wei said. ""We went to Japan because of Japanese customer demand, to Germany because of German customer demand, and four years ago to the US because of American customer demand,"" he said. ""Now, we are increasing our investment because the demand from US customers is extremely high."" ""Each time TSMC makes a strategic move, TSMC becomes stronger and more competitive"", Lai said. ""At the same time, it also provides Taiwanese enterprises with opportunities for international cooperation and contributes to Taiwan's greater strength."" Taiwan is a global powerhouse in semiconductor manufacturing, with more than half of the world's chips and nearly all of the high-end ones made there. The concentration of chip manufacturing in Taiwan has long been seen as a ""silicon shield"" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China - and an incentive for the US to defend it. TSMC's new US$100 billion investment sparked concerns that Trump was trying to take control of the company's production and that its growing US footprint could weaken Washington's willingness to protect Taiwan. Premier Cho Jung-tai said earlier on Thursday ""TSMC is 'Taiwan's TSMC'"" and the company's production capacity and advanced technology were ""rooted in Taiwan"".

 On Monday, March 3, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) would invest an additional $100 billion to expand its advanced semiconductor manufacturing operations in Arizona. This money will be put toward three new fabrication plants (or fabs), two advanced packaging facilities, and a major research and design (R&D) center. TSMC touted this as the largest single foreign direct investment in U.S. history, bringing its total investment to $165 billion and doubling its planned manufacturing plants from three to six. President Trump’s focus on semiconductors, and in particular Taiwan’s outsized role in the production of these tiny chips that enable modern life, is not new. He has repeatedly accused Taiwan, which produces around 90 percent of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, of stealing the U.S. chip industry. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs between 25 and 100 percent on all chips entering the United States to force companies to establish a manufacturing presence in the country. More on:

 Trump is not alone in worrying about U.S. overreliance on chips made in Taiwan, which are not only needed for smartphones and washing machines but also for most modern weapons systems. In 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act, which was intended to incentivize companies to build fabs in the United States. TSMC received $6.6 billion in direct funding and $5 billion in low-cost loans through the CHIPS Act to build a foundry in Arizona. Trump, though, has criticized this as a “ridiculous program,” stating, “we don’t want to give them billions of dollars.” With this announcement, TSMC is likely looking to avert tariffs, secure its CHIPS Act funding, and demonstrate Taiwan’s indispensable role in in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, which it hopes will translate into President Trump demonstrating broader political support for Taiwan. What Does This Mean for U.S. Manufacturing? Trumpeting the announcement alongside TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, President Trump declared that “The most powerful AI chips in the world will be made right here in America.” The investments will create tens of thousands of construction and engineering jobs, and, with TSMC’s first investments in advanced packaging in the United States, help strengthen the country’s semiconductor ecosystem and domestic AI supply chain. TSMC’s first Arizona fab, which started high volume chip production earlier this year, produces four nanometer (4nm) chips, which are used in Nvidia’s most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). The second fab, set to become operational in 2028, aims to produce 2nm and 3nm chips. The third, which is expected to come online at the end of the decade, will produce 2nm chips and more advanced technology. Trump claimed that the TSMC investment, along with investments planned by Samsung and others, could bring the United States to 40 percent of the global chipmaking market. But even with the expansion, it seems likely that TSMC will continue to produce the majority of the most advanced chips in Taiwan in the near term. More on:

Tariffs
 
Taiwan Strait
 What Questions Remain? President Trump has stated that he intends to levy massive tariffs on imported chips. One question is whether TSMC’s investment in the United States will be enough to grant the company a reprieve or whether Trump will still proceed with tariffs. Tariffs on chips could very well proceed, as Trump stated in the press conference announcing the investment, “if they did them in Taiwan to send them here, they’ll have 25 percent or 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the number may be someday…by doing it here, he has no tariffs.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick similarly remarked, “They’re coming here in huge size because they want to be in the greatest market in the world, and they want to avoid the tariffs that, if they’re not here, they’d have to suffer.” Given Trump’s repeated attacks on the CHIPS Act, it is uncertain whether his administration will continue to disburse funds provided under the law for semiconductor manufacturing and whether TSMC will receive the grants it has already been awarded. Interestingly, in announcing the investment, Wei touted the “needed government support” as a reason for the success of the company’s facility in Arizona. The biggest question, though, may concern the fate of Intel’s chip manufacturing business. While Intel used to dominate the production of semiconductors, it has since lost its leadership position and is struggling to compete with TSMC, Samsung, and others. Through the CHIPS Act, it received nearly $8 billion in grants, intended to help the company produce leading edge chips. Yet Intel has continued to struggle, and there have been reports that TSMC may take control of Intel’s manufacturing business in a new joint venture. Whether this remains a priority is another open question. How Will This Affect Taiwan? Some in Taiwan, including former president Tsai Ing-wen, have likened the island’s dominance of the semiconductor manufacturing industry to a “silicon shield” that protects it against Chinese aggression. The logic is that China would not attack Taiwan because it needs Taiwanese chips as inputs for the manufactured goods it produces, and aggression would therefore crater its economy. At the same time, U.S. reliance on Taiwanese chips and its desire to prevent this technology from falling into China’s hands would make it more likely to defend the island if deterrence fails. This is one reason why Taiwan has attempted to keep its most advanced semiconductor technology at home. Until yesterday, TSMC consistently insisted that its R&D would only occur in Taiwan, and that the most advanced chips would be made in Taiwan. This also has an economic logic: new chip production requires close coordination and proximity to specialized suppliers and experienced engineers, which are concentrated in Taiwan.  Some Taiwanese are unnerved by TSMC’s announcement, fearing that the United States is “hollowing out” the island and that once it establishes sufficient domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity it will abandon Taiwan. When Trump’s approach to Ukraine and his tilt toward Russia is added to the mix – he cut off U.S. military assistance to Ukraine only hours after announcing this deal – this only heightens fears on the island that Taiwan may be sold out as part of a larger U.S.-China deal. Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Nationalist Party (KMT), is seeking to stoke these fears. The leader of the KMT’s legislative caucus, Fu Kun-chi, asked “Where is Taiwan’s national security if TSMC become ASMC and the sacred mountain that protects the country is gone?” In response to these worries, a spokesperson in Taiwan’s presidential office stated that the government would ensure TSMC “will keep its most advanced manufacturing processes in Taiwan.” Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai has said the government is closely coordinating with industry, and the two are pursuing a strategy that serves Taiwan’s interests. At the same time, Wei said that TSMC would be “producing the most advanced chip on U.S. soil.” This may be a debate over semantics: TSMC may eventually produce its most advanced chips in the United States but this could well take years to come to fruition. What Does this Mean for U.S.-Taiwan Relations? TSMC’s huge investment should at the very least stabilize U.S.-Taiwan relations and could very well provide momentum for even closer ties. It has the potential to influence how President Trump ultimately views the value of Taiwan to the United States. He has previously voiced skepticism about defending Taiwan and reportedly doubted whether the United States could even do so, while also stating that Taiwan should pay the United States for protection. By demonstrating the contribution its companies can make toward reindustrializing the United States and the indispensable role that they will play in AI, though, Taiwan could change this narrative. At the same time, the U.S.-Taiwan relationship cannot be reduced to chips. The United States has commitments to Taiwan under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that predate the island’s emergence as a major technology power and it has interests beyond safeguarding access to chips. Regardless of the success of TSMC’s investment, the United States will still have a vital interest in Taiwan’s future and in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

TSMC CEO C.C. Wei also said at a news conference held at Taiwan’s presidential office, the company’s $100-billion investment plan announced this week would not impact the chipmaker’s expansion in Taiwan amid concerns it could damage the island’s semiconductor industry. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip maker, plans to build five additional chip facilities amid threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports. TSMC’s overseas investment plans also include projects in Japan and Germany. While TSMC plans to build three new production lines in the U.S. over coming years, it will build 11 more new production lines in Taiwan this year, Wei told reporters. “We will continue to build them (in Taiwan) because it is still not enough,” he said. The new U.S. expansion plan comes after Trump has repeatedly criticized Taiwan, saying it has taken away American semiconductor business and that he wants manufacturing to return to the United States. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te told reporters on Thursday that the government has received no pressure from Washington during TSMC’s latest investment process and his government would make sure the chip maker gets support for domestic expansion. Taiwan’s cabinet said on Tuesday it would review the investment, which requires government approval, but that it viewed overseas investments that would raise Taiwan’s overall competitiveness positively. Taiwan’s dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cellphones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up pressure to assert its sovereignty claims. As a key manufacturing partner to Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm, TSMC is central to the U.S. chip industry, and bringing more of its production to U.S. soil would solve a major supply chain risk for those firms. However, Trump said on Tuesday U.S. lawmakers should get rid of a landmark 2022 bipartisan law to give $52.7-billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. and use the proceeds to pay debt.
