Respect for Trump - I'm from the UK,"First off, I wanted to congratulate you Americans for having a leader who is actually putting his country first. I'm English, and embarrassed to live in a country which has become a laughing stock. To go from the British Empire to this, unacceptable.

I hope the day finally comes that the UK gets a leader like Trump. Someone so passionate about doing what is best for his country and making  sure the USA gets the best deal, best outcome in all possible negotiations. I want what you all have, here in the UK. 

I watched the discussions with Zelensky and couldn't have agreed more with President Trump. Why should American taxes fund the Ukrainan war... and if you do, why should you be left out of pocket (mineral agreement).

It's also difficult over here being a Trump fan too, far too many individuals have been brainwashed by the media and now think Trump is a nazi. But don't worry, I do what I can do to shut them down. They just don't understand - can't argue with stupid I guess.

Anyway, just wanted you to know there are those of us in the UK that want change. I hope it comes and I hope the UK can progress like the USA is under Trump.",242,81,2025-03-02 00:08:15,1j1dqf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/trump/comments/1j1dqf6/respect_for_trump_im_from_the_uk/

People in America should see this truth,"The U.S. has been supporting a war that isn’t even on its own continent—a gesture that should be seen as charity. However, this support is now being treated as an obligation. 

Meanwhile, Europe has had three years since the war began but has failed to significantly increase its military defense spending. They are not even willing to cut their own welfare spending to ramp up the budget, so that they can stand on their own feet. 

We sympathize with Ukraine’s situation and understand Zelenskyy’s frustration, but this is not the right way to seek help. More importantly, agreeing to meet in the Oval Office implies acceptance of the terms. Publicly criticizing the U.S. president in such a setting showed a complete lack of gratitude—not just toward him, but also toward the American people who have supported Ukraine.

Seriously, Americans have no stake in this war from the start. Zelenskyy cannot expect an endless support from USA, that’s unfair to the American people too cuz their hard earn money is being used to fund a war that’s far from their homeland.
