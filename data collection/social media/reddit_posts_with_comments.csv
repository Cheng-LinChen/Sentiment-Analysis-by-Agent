That is not a negotiable position. Don\'t you remember the line \'we don\'t negotiate with terrorists\'? Now you do. \n\nAnd before you say ""he just wants them not to join NATO"" or something, Ukraine was already country with majority support for not joining NATO with no plans to do so until Russia stole Crimea at which point it became slightly in favour. Now the support for joining NATO is circa 80% courtesy of finding out that Russia is the enemy who is quite happy to invade them and the west is the friend. \n\nAnd as for the election, aren\'t they all rigged these days anyway?', 'Ah, yes, the classic ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists‚Äù line‚Äîbecause obviously, every geopolitical conflict is just like a Hollywood action movie where one side is pure evil, and the other is heroically righteous. Very nuanced.\n\nLet‚Äôs actually look at history instead of relying on dramatic slogans. Wars don‚Äôt end because one side suddenly ‚Äúwins.‚Äù They end through negotiations, treaties, and diplomacy. Even the most brutal conflicts‚Äîthe Vietnam War, the Korean War, and the Cold War itself‚Äîended in talks, not total annihilation. Pretending otherwise is just wishful thinking dressed up as moral grandstanding.\n\nNow, about the NATO claim‚ÄîUkraine‚Äôs stance on NATO was not as simple as ‚ÄúRussia stole Crimea, so we joined the West.‚Äù There was already deep division within Ukraine regarding NATO and Russia long before 2014. The 2010 election saw Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian leader, win fairly on a platform of staying neutral. But once the 2014 coup (oh, sorry, ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù) installed a Western-backed government, NATO suddenly became a priority. That‚Äôs when Russia acted. Was it right? No. Was it completely unprovoked? Also no.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîif the goal is to prevent more death and destruction, shouldn‚Äôt peace talks be the priority? Saying ‚ÄúRussia just wants to make Ukraine Russia‚Äù ignores the fact that Ukraine and NATO refuse to discuss security guarantees that could stop this war. It‚Äôs not about surrender‚Äîit‚Äôs about stopping a bloodbath that is already claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. If you think endless war is a better solution than diplomacy, then maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink who actually benefits from this conflict‚Äîbecause it sure isn‚Äôt the people dying in it.']"

I hesitate to strongly form an opinion regarding what is and isn\'t an ""essential program.""\xa0\n\n\nBecause here\'s my opinion. (Again. . Sorry if you didn\'t ask for it.) The government for at least the last 10 years has been going downhill. (Longer, if we want to rope in the 2008 housing issue, and the 2005 bill that Biden financially backed to except student loans from bankruptcy, but I digress.) We\'ve had a pretty decent amount of both dem and repub hold the presidential title in the last few decades. But what hasn\'t changed is people who pull the strings yet don\'t have term limits on there jobs. People who have allegedly secretly stolen tax payer dollars, people who don\'t have to run for office but are still high enough in a government that their decisions make an impact.\xa0\n\n\nA truth for every country is this. When your borders are ""open"", when the internet is everywhere, you can no longer fill in your citizens on the plan. We\'ll always be under informed, and it doesn\'t matter how much research you do. Right now all we know is that the government is mass overspending, and A LOT of things need to get cut to mitigate that fact. And we don\'t have all the answers to be able to say for sure exactly what is and isn\'t essential because they can\'t tell us without telling the rest of the world. Somethings to us might be obviously essential, but could be getting hit with cuts and layoffs to purge ineffective employees who\'ve taken advantage of their position in one way or another.\xa0\n\n\nYou can also blame past spending for how much is necessary to cut, and you can blame that on whoever you want to, I suppose. Because other government employees and presidents have decided to continue to overspend, we\'re basically going into conservation mode. And when you don\'t have the money to spend, sometimes you have to go without laundry detergent to buy groceries. You can make a decent argument for what you think the government should be prioritizing when it comes to spending, but you don\'t know the whole story and neither do I. Idk. Maybe I\'m just naive by trying to accept it.\xa0\n\n\nObviously, don\'t just blindly accept things. That\'s how you get taken advantage of. But there has to be a middle ground, where you keep yourself as educated as you can, but accept that regardless of your opinion, someone who\'s calling the shots is making them with more information than you have. At that point it\'s up to your to decide whether or not you trust they\'ll make a decent decision. And if you decide you can\'t, just know there\'s nothing you can do about it, so you might as well be happy in spite of it.\xa0', '\n**The following is an automated message:**\n\nYour post was reported by the r/trump community members for not following these community and/or Reddit rule(s):\n\n- 8.

How many times have we gone to the sandbox to protect US owned oil fields?  We literally wiped out a Wagner unit without a single casualty over an oil field.  We invaded Iraq over our oil interests.  We‚Äôve been in a Cold War with Iran for 50 years that has turned hot multiple times over oil interests and the hostage situation at the embassy.  \n\nWe‚Äôll talk a lot about ideological interests and do nothing, but when it comes to money, us citizens lives, and resources we absolutely will fight.\n\nSo you think all these billionaires are just going to sit back and not push our politicians to fight when they have huge investments that are at risk in Ukraine? I mean seriously?  Do you think Putin would be stupid enough to risk that if the US actually committed to Ukraine like that?', 'My understanding is that Zelenskyy requested it be in the presence of the press.  \n\nPersonally I like Zelenskyy and I don‚Äôt buy the propaganda that he is profiting off the war or that he started it at all.  But I feel like he is letting his pride and emotions sabotage him at this point.  Going out and seeing the frontlines, going to military hospitals, seeing his country destroyed, everything has blurred his judgement.  He doesn‚Äôt want his countrymen‚Äôs sacrifices to be in vain and I don‚Äôt blame him.  But at this point the only way forward is to stop this war in any way possible to put an end to the killing and destruction of his country.  I don‚Äôt see any way the US or EU can save Ukraine anymore without initiating WW3.  We missed every opportunity we had to do that because we were scared to commit and risk starting it anyway.  Had we helped Ukraine more in 2014 or 2022, or even 2023 when pringles revolted we may have avoided this outcome.  But now Russia has rebounded a bit and the US public no longer really cares.  We cared when we were feeling the effects, when gas was $5 a gallon and we weren‚Äôt desensitized to the violence.  But now people are just ready for it to be over and they are more concerned with domestic policy and the economy.  It sucks, but it is where we are now.

China dominates this market because of cheap labor and lax environmental laws, making their production cost-efficient. However, the real issue isn‚Äôt just cost‚Äîit‚Äôs supply chain security. The U.S. and Europe rely heavily on China for rare earths, which is a strategic vulnerability. That‚Äôs why the U.S. is already investing in domestic production despite higher costs, and Ukraine‚Äôs resources could provide an alternative to Chinese dominance.\n\nThe claim that funding Ukraine and Israel is a betrayal of U.S. manufacturing ignores the reality that military aid directly benefits American defense industries. When the U.S. provides weapons and support, much of that money is spent on American-made arms from companies like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, keeping domestic production active and securing U.S. military readiness. Rather than killing manufacturing, defense spending is one of the last strongholds of U.S. industrial output.\n\nThe real reason American manufacturing declined has little to do with war spending and everything to do with outsourcing and automation. Corporations offshored jobs for cheap labor, trade deals like NAFTA accelerated this shift, and automation replaced factory workers. Blaming defense spending for this ignores the fact that the military-industrial sector is actually one of the last areas keeping U.S. manufacturing alive.
